Homer Simpson: What? Why? Oh, yeah. (FORCED POLITENESS) Hello Patty, hello Selma. How was your trip?
Marge Simpson: (READS) "Dear friends of the Simpson family: We had some sadness and some gladness this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new little cat, Snowball II...so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by herself. Lisa got straight A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all..."

Homer Simpson: Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas so much.
Homer Simpson: (GRUMBLING) ...Every year.
Marge Simpson: All right, children. Let me have those letters. I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole.
Bart Simpson: Oh, please. (TO LISA) There's only one fat guy that brings us presents and his name ain't Santa.
Marge Simpson: A pony? Oh, Lisa. You've asked for that for the last three years and I keep telling you Santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh. Can't you take a hint?
Lisa Simpson: But I really want a pony and I've been really, really good this year.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) Oh, dear. Maybe Bart is a little more realistic.
Marge Simpson: (SHOCKED) A tattoo!
Homer Simpson: A what!
Bart Simpson: Yeah, they're cool and they last the rest of the your life.

Patty Bouvier: Hello, Marge. It's Patty. Selma and I couldn't be more excited about seeing our baby sister for Christmas eve.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit, too.
Patty Bouvier: Somehow I doubt that Homer's excited. Of all the men you could have married, I don't know why you picked the one who's always so rude to us.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)

Homer Simpson: (GASPS) It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone.

Homer Simpson: Sorry, Barney. I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on Christmas eve.
Barney Gumble: Come on, Simpson. The dog's name is Whirlwind, ten to one shot. Money in the bank.
Homer Simpson: Uh-uh.
Bart Simpson: Ah, come on Dad, this can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's gonna happen to us.

Patty Bouvier: Oh, nothing dear. I'm just trashing your father.
Lisa Simpson: Well I wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have. Therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me. And I am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts.

Martin Prince: Mrs. Krabappel, isn't Bart supposed to face the window so he won't be tempted to look at his neighbor's paper?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: You're right, Martin. Bart?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Remember to visualize the complex problems. And relax. The test will start... NOW!
Bart Simpson: (QUIETLY, TO HIMSELF) At seven-thirty a.m. an express train traveling sixty miles an hour leaves Santa Fe bound for Phoenix, five hundred and twenty miles away.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (WHISPERING, TAPS HER HEAD) Shhhhh! Visualize it, Bart!
Bart Simpson: At the same time a local train traveling thirty miles an hour and carrying forty passengers leaves Phoenix bound for Santa Fe.
Bart Simpson: It's eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car.
Bart Simpson: An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off, but three times as many plus six get on.
Bart Simpson: Oof!
Bart Simpson: At the second stop, half the passengers plus two get off, but twice as many get on as got on at the first stop.
Conductor: Ticket, please.
Bart Simpson: (FRIGHTENED) I don't have a ticket.
Conductor: Come with me, boy.
Conductor: We've got a stowaway, sir.
Martin Prince: Twice the fare from Tucson to Flagstaff minus two thirds of the fare from Albuquerque to El Paso. (LAUGHS DEMONICALLY)
Bart Simpson: Yaaaaahhh!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Bart, there are students in this class with a chance to do well. Will you stop bothering them?
Martin Prince: He's not bothering me, Mrs. Krabappel. I'm finished. May I go outside and read under a tree?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Certainly, Martin.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: What are you looking at, Bart? Are those naughty dogs back again?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: You have twenty minutes, class.
(Springfield Elementary School Playground: ext. school playground - LATER)
Marge Simpson: He's a good boy now, and he's getting better, and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard.
Homer Simpson: That's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. (NOTICES THE PICTURE OF THE PRINCIPAL) Hey, look at this! "I am a weiner." (CHUCKLES) He sure is!
(Skinner's Office: int. principal skinner's office)
Secretary: (OVER INTERCOM) Mr. and Mrs. Simpson are here.
Seymour Skinner: Send them in.
Marge Simpson: Hello again, Principal Skinner.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) What have you done this time, boy?
Seymour Skinner: I caught your son defacing school property this morning. We estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and, frankly, we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?
Homer Simpson: Oh, no. He can't mean that.
Homer Simpson: My wife thinks you want me to pay for it.
Seymour Skinner: That was the idea.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Seymour Skinner: By itself something like this might not call for an extreme penalty...but this is not an isolated incident. Bart's behavior is unruly. He's frequently absent from school, then gives teachers pathetic excuse notes...that are obviously childish forgeries when compared to...
Seymour Skinner: Well, at any rate, it is my reluctant decision --
Secretary: (THRU INTERCOM) Mr. Skinner, Doctor Pryor is here to see you. He says it's urgent.
Seymour Skinner: (INTO INTERCOM) Send him in.
Rod #2: (FROM SCREEN) We're radioactive!
Seymour Skinner: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, this our district psychiatrist, Dr. J. Loren Pryor.
Homer Simpson: What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Oh, on the contrary. I have some very exciting news for all of us. This aptitude test we administered this morning has revealed that young Bart here is what we call a "gifted child".
Homer Simpson: A what?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Your son is a genius, Mr. Simpson.
Marge Simpson: Bart?
Homer Simpson: This lunkhead?
Seymour Skinner: Impossible.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: No, no, we're quite certain. The child is not supposed to know his own I.Q., of course, but, uh, you can see it's beyond the range of any doubt.
Homer Simpson: (AMAZED) Nine hundred and twelve?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh, no, you have it upside down. It's two hundred and sixteen.
Homer Simpson: (CRESTFALLEN) Oh.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: That's still amazingly high.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Tell me, Bart, are you ever bored in school?
Bart Simpson: Oh, you bet.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Um-hmmm... Ever feel a little frustrated?
Bart Simpson: All the time, sir.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh-huh. Do you ever dream of leaving your class to pursue your own intellectual development on an independent basis?
Bart Simpson: Wow, it's like you're readin' my mind, man.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: (TO PARENTS) A-ha... You see, when a child with Bart's intellect is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person, he's probably going to lash out in ways (PICKS UP BART'S FILES) like these.
Seymour Skinner: (ASIDE TO DR. PRYOR) I think we should re-test him.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: No, no, I think we should move him to another school.
Seymour Skinner: Oh. Better yet.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Bart, we'd like you to try a kind of school that doesn't rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers. (WAVES HIS HAND IN A DISMISSING FASHION) A school without walls. Where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to. Does that sound good, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Sign me up, Doc.
Homer Simpson: Come on, Bart, your mother's only trying to help. So go ahead and enjoy the show.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Excellent. We're all set, then. Here's all the information you need. (HANDS BART SOME LEAFLETS) Show up around nine-ish. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, congratulations once again.
Seymour Skinner: I think we're all in a mood to celebrate.
Homer Simpson: Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Well, genius-level intelligence is usually the result of heredity and environment...
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh... although, in some cases it's a total mystery.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN)
Bart Simpson: Aw, come on, Mom.
Marge Simpson: You look very intelligent, dear.
Bart Simpson: No way.
Homer Simpson: How 'bout a tie, son? Everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties.
Bart Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) You're stifling my creativity, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, boy.
Marge Simpson: Bart, this is a big day for you. Why don't you eat something a little more nutritious?
Homer Simpson: Nonsense, Marge! Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today.
Homer Simpson: It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. Lisa, maybe you should try some of this.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up.
Lisa Simpson: (TO BART, QUIETLY) I don't care what that stupid test says, Bart. You're a dimwit.
Bart Simpson: (QUIETLY, TO LISA) Maybe so, but from now on, this dimwit is on Easy Street.
(Homer's Car: EXT. HOMER'S CAR - MORNING)
Bart Simpson: No rush, Dad. Take the scenic route.
Homer Simpson: Gotcha!
(NEW SCHOOL: EXT. NEW SCHOOL)
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY)
Bart Simpson: Oh, no. Ties.
Homer Simpson: Don't worry son, you can have mine. Here, let me show you how to put on a tie.
Homer Simpson: The hook goes over the top and these things go in there.
Bart Simpson: Thanks, Dad.
Bart Simpson: You kissed me.
Marge Simpson: Nurturing your brilliant brain, so I got tickets to the opera tonight. Hurry up, get dressed! It starts at eight.
Homer Simpson: Well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, I think. Now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations. You may outsmart someone.
Ms. Melon: You must be Bart Simpson. I'm Ms. Melon (PRONOUNCED ME-LAN), your learning coordinator.
Ms. Melon: Let me say right at the start that we have one rule here: Make your own rules. If you feel sleepy, take a nap. If you get bored, feel free to take out a book and start reading.
Bart Simpson: What should I read, ma'am?
Ms. Melon: Why, anything you want, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Ohhh!
Ms. Melon: A comic book. How did this get mixed in here? We used it last week as a prop in a film we made about illiteracy.
Ms. Melon: Bart, these are the students who will share your work area. This is Ethan Foley.
Ethan Foley: O Memsahib Bart, Rabbi has memo.
Bart Simpson: What?
Ms. Melon: (WRITES ON THE BLACKBOARD) Ethan is very good with palindromes -- you know, sentences spelled the same backwards and forwards. And this is Sidney Swift.
Sydney: "Trab, ing norm doog."
Bart Simpson: What's your problem?
Ms. Melon: Oh, don't mind Sidney. He's just speaking in backwards phonetics today. He said "Good morning, Bart". And this is Cecile Shapiro.
Cecile Shapiro: Hi, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Cool. Hamsters! (TAPS ON CAGE) What are their names?
Cecile Shapiro: (LOOKS PUZZLED) Hamster number one has been infected with a staphylococci virus. Hamster number two is the control hamster.
Bart Simpson: Hi, li'l control hamster.
Ms. Melon: I wouldn't get too attached, Bart. We're dissecting him next week.
Ms. Melon: Discover your desks, people.
Ms. Melon: Now, let's all welcome the newest member of our collective experience, Bart Simpson.
Ms. Melon: And now we can continue our debate from yesterday. When we left off, Calvin and Tanya were arguing that free will is an illusion.
Bart Simpson: Oh, Mom! Not tonight.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you're going, too.
Ian: If you ask me, humankind has freedom, a freedom fraught with paradoxes. Freud shows how childhood shapes our subconscious mind, but this helps us to think for ourselves.
Ms. Melon: Very good, Ian. Does anyone else have an example of a paradox? (THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HANDS)
Ethan Foley: Without law and order, man has no freedom.
Cecile Shapiro: If you want peace, you must prepare for war.
Ms. Melon: Um-hmm, um-hmm... Well, it seems the smartest child in the class is also the quietest. Bart, what other paradoxes affect our lives?
Bart Simpson: Well... you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.
Ms. Melon: Well, I guess that would be a paradox, too. (CHUCKLES) Thank you, Bart.
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Whew!
Calvin: Tell you what, Bart! I'll trade you the weight of a bowling ball on the eighth moon of Jupiter from my lunch for the weight of a feather on the second moon of Neptune from your lunch.
Bart Simpson: Well, okay.
Calvin: There you go.
Sydney: I will trade you one thousand picoliters of my milk for four gills of yours.
Bart Simpson: Well, all right.
Sydney: Anything you say.
Ian: Uh, Bart, would you wager your cupcake against my...
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) Save your breath.
Ethan Foley: What do you think of the new kid?
Ian: A rather mediocre genius.
Calvin: Yes, not very bright at all.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING)
Homer Simpson: So, how was it?
Bart Simpson: Os-os.
Homer Simpson: What?
Bart Simpson: That's backwards for so-so.
Homer Simpson: Wow! What are you readin' there? (LOOKS) Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?
Homer Simpson: Tell you what: To celebrate your first day of genius school, whaddaya say we go out for a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?
Bart Simpson: All righty!
Marge Simpson: Bart, I feel so bad for going so many years without... uh... hmmm... What's that word where you encourage something to grow?
Homer Simpson: But I'm not a genius. Why should I suffer?
(Opera House: INT. OPERA HOUSE)

Marge Simpson: Shush.
Marge Simpson: Shhh!
Homer Simpson: Who's the lard butt?
Lisa Simpson: He's the bullfighter.
Bart Simpson: No way a bull is gonna miss a target that big, man.

Bart Simpson: It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
Homer Simpson: Is that one fat enough for you, son?
Homer Simpson: Let's go get a burger.
(CLASSROOM: INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING)
Ms. Melon: So Y equals R cubed over three, and if you determine the rate of change in this curve correctly, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
Ms. Melon: Well, don't you get it, Bart? Derivative D-Y equals three R squared D R over three, or R squared D R, or R D R R. Hardy-har-har! Get it?
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah. (A WEAK CHUCKLE)

Bart Simpson: Oh, no.
Homer Simpson: Well, I guess we don't have to do that.
Bart Simpson: Um, look Dad, I got something to tell you.
Homer Simpson: Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark.

Bart Simpson: Uh, nothin', Pop.
(NEW CLASSROOM: int. new classroom - later that morning)
Ms. Melon: I'm still trying to get you a lab partner, Bart. If we don't get any volunteers soon, I'll assign somebody. Say, what's that? It looks dangerous.

Bart Simpson: 'Course I do!
(SCHOOL BUILDING: ext. school building)

(OLD SCHOOL: int. old school - dr. pryor's office)
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Now, Bart, we want to emphasize that nobody's angry about this. We're... we're just concerned. When a young man with a two hundred sixteen I.Q. can't make a simple experiment work, well, it doesn't take a Bart Simpson to figure out that something's wrong. Tell me, is the class moving too slowly for you?
Bart Simpson: Lord, no.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Well then what can we do to make you happy?
Bart Simpson: I want to go back to my old class.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Oh, but, Bart, don't you remember the boredom... the ennui... the intellectual malaise?
Bart Simpson: Yeah, well, you know... kinda... but I was thinking I could go undercover.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Undercover? Bart, I'm intrigued. Go on.
Bart Simpson: Well, I could pretend I'm a regular dumb kid. You know... to study them, and all the stuff they do with each other. You know, see what makes them tick.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: I see... like Jane Goodall and the chimps.
Bart Simpson: Yeah.
Rod #1: (FROM SCREEN) Of course we're hot.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh-huh, this is most impressive, Bart. You write up your proposal while I talk to Principal Skinner.
Bart Simpson: Proposal?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: You know, outline your project, what you hope to achieve, what you'll require to do it.
Bart Simpson: Gotcha, man.
Bart Simpson: "My Proposal" by Bart Simpson. I want to pretend I am a regular dumb kid... period. By this I hope... oh no... for this I will... um... require... (SIGHS; ALOUD) Aw, man!
Bart Simpson: (SIGHS) "My Confession" by Bart Simpson. I am a regular dumb kid... period. I cheated on my intelligence test... period.

Bart Simpson: I'm not a genius, Dad.
Homer Simpson: What?
Bart Simpson: I cheated on the intelligence test. I'm sorry. But I just want to say that the past few weeks have been great. Me and you have done stuff together, you've helped me out with things, and we're closer than we've ever been. I love you, Dad, and I think if something can bring us that close, it can't possibly be bad.

(Park: ext. park - day)
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer. I am so proud of you.
Homer Simpson: (DOWN) Proud. Proud of what?
Marge Simpson: Well, everything. (GESTURING) Your dip sign, for instance. Now people won't be caught off-guard by that little (MAKES DIP GESTURE WITH HER HAND) in the road.
Homer Simpson: Ah, what a great family! But come on, we all know this is small potatoes. There is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together.
Lisa Simpson: What, Dad?
Homer Simpson: I'm talking about that!
Marge Simpson: You don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses?
Lisa Simpson: Wow!

Crowd: (CHANTING) Homer! Homer!
Homer Simpson: (INTO bullhorn) Thank you.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah!
Homer Simpson: (INTO bullhorn) Unlike most of you, I am not a nut. Just a good, honest American who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur.
(Burns's Office: INT. Montgomery Burns' Office)
C. Montgomery Burns: (SIGHS) Look at that man. He has the crowd in the palm of his hand. Haven't seen anything like it since Jolson. Who is he?
Waylon Smithers: (Hands Burns binoculars) That's Homer Simpson, sir. He used to work here in the plant, but we fired him for gross incompetence.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, so that's his little game. Get this Simpson character up here right now.
Waylon Smithers: But, Mr. Burns --
C. Montgomery Burns: I said, DO IT! NOW, DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: EXT. Power Plant)
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN) Our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I. Many of them, incompetent boobs. I know this because I have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say, this stinks!
Bart Simpson: Right on, Dad!
Waylon Smithers: Hey, hey, Simpson.
Waylon Smithers: Burns wants to talk to you, privately.

Homer Simpson: Same here.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson. I want you to rejoin our power plant family.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, no can do!
C. Montgomery Burns: Hear me out, Simpson. I don't want you to come back as a Technical Supervisor, or Supervising Technician, or whatever the hell you used to do. I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant.
Homer Simpson: Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about.
C. Montgomery Burns: The generous offer I'm making is good for exactly thirty seconds, Simpson.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah!
Homer Simpson: Hey! What's the problem here?
Homer Simpson: (THINKS) Me in charge of safety? This place could blow sky-high. (THEN) Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. (THEN) Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. (THEN) I can't let Marge support the family. (THEN) This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I...
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson! Time's up!
Homer Simpson: Umm... What the hey. I'll take the job.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent! Your first duty will be to step out on the (GESTURING) balcony and tell that crowd this plant is safe.
Homer Simpson: (GASP) What?
C. Montgomery Burns: Go on, Homer.
Lisa Simpson: Go, Dad!
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN) Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN) Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back.
Homer Simpson: I can't do it, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: You mean you're willing to give up a good job and a raise just for your principles?
Homer Simpson: Hmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. But that's the lug you're looking at. And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have crusading for safety. Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job.
C. Montgomery Burns: You're not as stupid as you look... or sound... or our best testing indicates.
C. Montgomery Burns: You've got the job. Now get to work.
Homer Simpson: I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.
(PLANT: ext. plant)
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN; SNIFFLING) Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us.
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN; COVERING) ...and I'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. The only reason I'm telling you this is I'm going to be leaving you.
Homer Simpson: But, don't worry. I've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!
Bart Simpson: Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad watch out!
Homer Simpson: Whoa! Easy! Don't drop me! Be careful.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - morning)

Bart Simpson: No, I don't!

Marge Simpson: (MURMUR OF ASSENT)
Homer Simpson: (INDICATING GELATIN) Are you sure that's enough? You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.
Marge Simpson: (FLATTERED) Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it. Once.

C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, please, please, don't fight. Just go out back and have a good time.

Bart Simpson: Bart.
Homer Simpson: Don't correct the man, Brat. (TO BURNS) Oh, Boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, for the love of Peter! That's all anybody brought. Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop. Well, toss it in the pile over there.
C. Montgomery Burns: And make yourselves at home.
Bart Simpson: Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself.
Homer Simpson: Why you, listen to me you...

Marge Simpson: Oh, I'm not much of a drinker.
Mrs. Long: (POINTING O.S.) Hey, isn't that your boy there, torturing the swans?

Homer Simpson: (GRUMBLES) You remember the rules from last year?
Bart Simpson: Yeah. Shut my mouth and let your boss win.
Bart Simpson: Hey!
Wife #1: I don't know who to love more. My son Joshua, who is captain of the football team, or my daughter Amber, who got the lead in the school play. Usually I use their grades as a tie-breaker, but they both got straight A's this term, so what's a mother to do?
Marge Simpson: Uh-huh. Well, uh... I sense greatness in my family.
Wife #2: Your family?
Marge Simpson: Well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there and if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average. (FINISHES DRINK; TIPSILY) I don't want to alarm anyone, but I think there's a li'l al-key-hol in this punch.

Lisa Simpson: Hey!
Homer Simpson: Look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. We've got to do better as a family. So tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV. We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family.

I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my French... but they act like savages! Did you see them at the picnic? Oh, of course you did. You're everywhere. You're omnivorous.

Homer Simpson: Whoops. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Well, if you had been paying attention, perhaps you would have noticed that your family sees you as a rather stern authority figure - an ogre, if you will.
Marge Simpson: Now, Doctor, that's not true.
Lisa Simpson: "Ogre" is such a strong word.
Bart Simpson: Right on, Doc. Another successful diagnosis.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Whoa! (CHUCKLE) Okay, you want to kill each other. That's good. That's healthy. There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict. All I ask is that you use my patented aggression therapy mallets.
Homer Simpson: Good idea.
Bart Simpson: All right!
Marge Simpson: (TROUBLED) I don't know...
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Okay, let's take another deep, cleansing breath.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. What's the point?
Bart Simpson: They'd work much better without the padding, Doc.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, no. That's not true.
Bart Simpson: See.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Ow! Gimme that.
(Bathroom: int. bathroom)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (MAD) Yes, well, that concludes this portion of our treatment.
Marge Simpson: Are we cured yet?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Don't be ridiculous. You will be cured, but it's going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods.
Homer Simpson: Unortho what?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Don't worry, I'll have plenty of time to explain while I warm up the electric generator.
(DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY: int. dr. monroe's laboratory - a little later)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Everyone comfy? Good. Now, don't touch any of those buttons in front of you, for a very important reason, i.e. you are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--
Homer Simpson: Arrrgh!
Bart Simpson: Just testing.
Homer Simpson: Why you...
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, Homer! Not yet!
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: You see, this is what is known as aversion therapy. When someone hurts you emotionally, you will hurt them physically, and gradually you will learn not to hurt each other at all. And won't that be wonderful, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (SEEMINGLY MOVED) Oh, yes, doctor.
Bart Simpson: Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson: Arrrgh!
Marge Simpson: Bart, how could you shock your little sister?
Bart Simpson: My finger slipped.
Bart Simpson: Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson: So did mine.
Marge Simpson: Bart! Lisa! Stop that.
Lisa Simpson: Arrrgh!
Homer Simpson: Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson: Arrrgh!
Marge Simpson: Arrrgh!

Marge Simpson: Gee, I thought we were making real progress.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, I'm sorry, you're not. Please, you've just got to go.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Doc! Your TV commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Oh but that was just... All right. (TO RECEPTIONIST) Get the money.
(Waiting Room: int. waiting room - a little later)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (HANDING THE MONEY TO HOMER) (INDECIPHERABLE COUNTING) five hundred. Here! Just go, and never tell anyone you were here.
Homer Simpson: Wow! Five hundred smackers!
Marge Simpson: Homer, how wonderful. Our first pleasant surprise.
Lisa Simpson: It's not the money as much as the feeling that we earned it.
Bart Simpson: You did it, Dad.
Marge Simpson: Excuse me, dear. Shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back?
Homer Simpson: That piece of junk? Forget it! We're going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
Bart Simpson: Yay!

Lisa Simpson: It's Mrs. Hoover's birthday!
Bart Simpson: You know, there are names for people like you.
Lisa Simpson: No there aren't.
Bart Simpson: Teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt kisser...
Homer Simpson: Bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing.
Bart Simpson: Huh?
Homer Simpson: Well, you see, boy. It never hurts to grease the wheels a little.
Lisa Simpson: I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad. I like my teacher.
Homer Simpson: Surely, Lisa. (To BART) You see how it works, Bart? (GESTURING WITH CUPCAKE) A cupcake here, a good grade there.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I get good grades 'cause I'm smart and I pay attention and I study hard.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, right, Lis. (TO BART) It's the three roads to success, Bart. Work, brains, and... (GESTURES WITH CUPCAKE)

Otto Mann: That's bad news, man.
Lisa Simpson: Here, Otto, I made an extra one for you.
Otto Mann: Oh, thanks, little lady.
Lisa Simpson: (PLEASED) You're welcome.
Bart Simpson: Better let me hold these, Lis.

Lisa Simpson: Tell me more.
Bart Simpson: (EXASPERATED GRUNT) Backscratcher! Foot licker! Honor student!
Lisa Simpson: (SMUGLY) You'll never get one now, Mr. Name-caller.
Bart Simpson: (THE VOICE OF REASON) All right, all right. Look. I'm sorry. I-I got upset. In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn't mean.
Lisa Simpson: You weren't thinking, were you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: I'm not a sniveling toad, am I?
Bart Simpson: Not really.
Bart Simpson: Does not.
Lisa Simpson: I'm not a little egg sucker, am I?
Bart Simpson: Of course not.
Lisa Simpson: Then what am I?
Bart Simpson: A beautiful human being.

Bart Simpson: So give her back those cupcakes before I knock your block off.
Lisa Simpson: Don't Bart! He's a friend of Nelson Muntz.
Weasel #1: Nelson, you're bleeding.
Nelson Muntz: Nah. This happens all the time. Somebody else's blood splatters on me.
Nelson Muntz: Hey, wait a minute. You're right. (TO BART) You made me bleed my own blood.
Bart Simpson: (SUDDENLY FRIGHTENED) Uh, it was an ACCIDENT, man. A terrible ghastly mistake! Ask anybody!

Homer Simpson: So, what's the problem, son?
Bart Simpson: (INTIMATE) I had a run-in with a bully.
Marge Simpson: A bully?!
Homer Simpson: Come on, Marge. I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa.
Marge Simpson: Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight to the principal about this.
Bart Simpson: I guess I could do that.
Homer Simpson: What? And violate the code of the school yard? I'd rather Bart died.
Marge Simpson: What on earth are you talking about, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (AMAZED AT HER IGNORANCE) The code of the School yard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see... Don't tattle... Always make fun of those different from you... Never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... Hmmm, what else... ?
Bart Simpson: I know. (COUGHS UP BASEBALL CAP)
Marge Simpson: Oh Homer, that's ridiculous. (GROANS) Bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding?
Bart Simpson: What do you mean, Mom?
Homer Simpson: (MYSTIFIED) Yeah, right! This ought to be good for a laugh.
Marge Simpson: Shh! This bully friend of yours... Is he a little on the chunky side?
Bart Simpson: Yeah, - he's pretty chunkified, all right.
Marge Simpson: Huh huh. And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either.
Bart Simpson: No. He's pretty dumb. He's in all the same special classes I am.
Marge Simpson: That's why he lashes out at the world.
Homer Simpson: Aw, Marge.
Marge Simpson: So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go.
Homer Simpson: Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi. Let's go, boy.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: Now here's that bully of yours. Show me your stuff.
Homer Simpson: No, no! Not like that! Like this!
Homer Simpson: See, that boy? You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he.
Bart Simpson: (DISBELIEVING) You mean I should fight dirty, Dad?
Homer Simpson: Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.
Bart Simpson: Amen.
Homer Simpson: So the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded...
Bart Simpson: (STARTING TO UNDERSTAND) Yeah!
Homer Simpson: And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
Bart Simpson: Gotcha.
Homer Simpson: And if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations.

Herman Hermann: Okay... The key to Springfield has always been Elm Street: The Greeks knew it. The Carthaginians knew it. Now you know it. First, you'll need a declaration of war.
Herman Hermann: That way everything you do will be nice and legal. (LOOKING OVER DOCUMENT) Okay, I can use this one from the Franco­ Prusssian War. I'll just change Otto von Bismark to read Bart Simpson and...

Lisa Simpson: I'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of its car. The Iowa farmer whose land has been taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats. The West Virginia coal miner, coughing up his...
Dewey Largo: Well, that's all fine and good, but Lisa, none of those unpleasant people are going to be at the recital next week.
Dewey Largo: Now, class. From the top. Five, six, seven...
(LUNCHROOM: int. lunchroom - later that day)
Lisa Simpson: Every day at noon a bell rings and they herd us in here for feeding time. And we sit around like cattle, chewing our cuds, dreading the inevitable...
Bart Simpson: (HOLLERING HAPPILY) Food fight!
JANEY: C'mon, Lees, what are you waiting for?
JANEY: Chuck that spaghetti!
Lisa Simpson: I choose not to participate.
(EXERCISE ROOM: int. EXERCISE ROOM - later that day)
Ms. Barr: Lisa, we are playing dodge ball here. The object of the game is to avoid the ball by weaving or ducking out of its path.
Lisa Simpson: In other words, to dodge the ball.
Ms. Barr: Listen, missy, just tell me why you weren't getting out of the way of those balls.
Lisa Simpson: I'm too sad.
Ms. Barr: Too sad to play dodge ball? That's ridiculous. Now, let's see some enthusiasm! Play ball!
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - afternoon)
Homer Simpson: Come on, come on. Let's go.
Bart Simpson: In the red trunks, with a record of forty-eight wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, Battling Bart Simpson. (WHISTLES) Whoopee! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh, correction, humiliating defeats -- all of them by knockout...
Homer Simpson: (QUIET DIGNITY) Must you do this every time?
Bart Simpson: ...Homer "The Human Punching Bag" Simpson. Boo! Boo! Hiss!
Bart Simpson: And Homer is down! (LAUGH) Three seconds, folks -- a new record!
Homer Simpson: Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on!
Homer Simpson: Okay. Here we go.
Bart Simpson: Yo, chump, you back again?
Homer Simpson: (GRUNTS) Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid!
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Ohhh... get out of the corner!
Marge Simpson: But they sent a note from school.
Homer Simpson: (CONCENTRATING) What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way.
Bart Simpson: I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. There's no way they can prove anything.
Marge Simpson: No, Bart. This note isn't about you.
Bart Simpson: It isn't? There must be some mistake.
Bart Simpson: Hey, you're right. This note's about Lisa.
Homer Simpson: Lisa?
Homer Simpson: (READING) "Lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad." Well, she doesn't look sad. (PEERING CLOSELY AT LISA) I don't see any tears in her eyes.
Lisa Simpson: It's not that kind of sad. I'm sorry, Dad, but you wouldn't understand.
Homer Simpson: Oh, sure I would, princess. I have feelings, too. You know, like "my stomach hurts" or "I'm going crazy". Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it?
Lisa Simpson: I'm just wondering, what's the point? Would it make any difference at all if I never existed? How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?
Homer Simpson: Well... eh... er...eh...
Homer Simpson: Come on, Lisa... ride the Homer horsey. Giddiyap! Whee! (chuckles)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs and I'll draw you a nice hot bath? That helps me when I feel sad.
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, Dad. I know you mean well.
Homer Simpson: (TO LISA) Thanks for knowing I mean well.
Bart Simpson: Gee, Homer. Looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands.
Homer Simpson: You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor!
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, I didn't do anything wrong.
Homer Simpson: In times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. Now hop to it, boy!
(LIVING ROOM: int. living room - a little later)
Bart Simpson: (GRUMBLES) Stupid Homer... (MUMBLES) Thinks he's so big... Stupid Homer...(MORE MUMBLING) Stupid Homer. I'll show him.
Bart Simpson: (MAD) Enjoy your bath?
Lisa Simpson: No. Not really.
Bart Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Oh. Too bad. Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub.
Homer Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: (TO MAGGIE) So typical of Bart. All he thinks about is himself.
Bart Simpson: Hey, don't say stuff like that about me to Maggie. She's on my side, anyway.
Lisa Simpson: Is not.
Bart Simpson: Is, too.
Lisa Simpson: Is not.
Bart Simpson: Is, too.
Lisa Simpson: Is not.
Bart Simpson: Is, too. Watch, I'll prove it. Maggie, come to the one you love best.
Lisa Simpson: (DRAGGED INTO IT) No, Maggie! (BECKONING) Come here, girl. Come to me.
Bart Simpson: Come on, Maggie. The choice is obvious.
Lisa Simpson: No, Maggie, don't go for the glitter. Look for substance.
Lisa Simpson: All right Maggie, just go to Bart.
Bart Simpson: Exactly, come to the one you love.
Homer Simpson: Oh, no, come on! Don't let that boy -- get out of the... Oh, no, not again! Don't. Don't. Don't. Great, get over. Oh, geeze.
Bart Simpson: Gee, Dad, you're really bad at this.
Homer Simpson: I am not. It's just that (LISA'S SAX IS HEARD) I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. (CALLING) Lisa! Lisa!
(Lisa's Bedroom: int. lisa's bedroom - night - continuous)
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) Lisa, what did I tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house?
Lisa Simpson: (SADLY) I was just playing the blues... (PAUSE) ...Dad.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy.
Lisa Simpson: No, that's okay, Dad. (SNIFFS) I'll just work on my fingering. Unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you.
Homer Simpson: (SINCERE) Let's hear it.
Homer Simpson: You just clack as loud as you want. Lis.
Lisa Simpson: I've got to find that sound.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson's house - continuous)
(Street: EXT. STREET - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT)
(Bridge: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT)
Lisa Simpson: That was beautiful. What's it called?
Bleeding Gums Murphy: It's a little tune that I call the "I Never Had An Italian Suit Blues."
(Simpson Master Bedroom: int. homer and marge's bedroom - night)
Jacqueline Bouvier: Wait, Margie. Before you go out that door, let's put our happy face on. Because people know how good a mommy you have by the size of your smile.
Homer Simpson: What th...
Bart Simpson: Put up your dukes, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
Homer Simpson: Bart, go easy on me. I'm your Dad.
Bart Simpson: I am going easy on you, but you're just so old and slow and weak and pathetic.
Homer Simpson: No, Bart, no.
Marge Simpson: Homer, wake up! Wake up! Oh my, here let me wipe off that drool.
Homer Simpson: You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life is when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So why are you still awake?
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa. I don't know, Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs attention, but all the while our little Lisa's becoming a young woman.
Homer Simpson: Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR) Good night, Homer.
(Bridge: ext. bridge - night)
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (AS SHE PLAYS) Now -- low B-flat.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Okay, Lisa -- altissimo register.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Very nice, very nice. I once ruptured myself doing that.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks, Mr. Murphy.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: My friends call me Bleeding Gums.
Lisa Simpson: Ew! How'd you get a name like that?
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Well, let me put it this way. You ever been to the dentist?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Not me. I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my life as it is.
Lisa Simpson: I have problems, too.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Well, I can't help you, kid. I'm just a terrific horn player with tons of soul. But I can jam with you.
Lisa Simpson: Okay.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (SINGS) OH I'M SO LONELY, SINCE MY BABY LEFT ME / I GOT NO MONEY, AND NOTHING IS FREE / OH I BEEN SO LONELY, SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN / ALL I GOT IS THIS RUSTY... THIS RUSTY OLD HORN.
Lisa Simpson: (SINGS) "I got a bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, she gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo / I'm the sa...dest kid in grade number two."
Bart Simpson: Aw come on, I'll cheer you up.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: You know, you play pretty well for someone with no real problems.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, but I don't feel any better.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: The blues isn't about feeling better. It's about making other people feel worse and making a few bucks while you're at it. Which reminds me, if you're ever in the neighborhood, I'm playing at a little club called the Jazz Hole...
Marge Simpson: Lisa, get away from that jazzman!
Lisa Simpson: But Mom, can't I... stay a little longer?
Marge Simpson: Come on, come on. We were worried about you. (TO MURPHY) Nothing personal. I just fear the unfamiliar.
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - the next day)
Newsman: (FROM TV) Today's fire raced through downtown Springfield gutting Symphony Hall, the Springfield Museum of Natural History, the Springfield Arts Center...

Homer Simpson: Oh, no, Marge!
(KITCHEN: int. kitchen)
Homer Simpson: Marge, are you all right?
Marge Simpson: No, I'm very upset.
Homer Simpson: Then you've heard. Oh, God. What are we doing to do? The lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!
Marge Simpson: I'm upset about Lisa.
Homer Simpson: Oh. Me, too.
Bart Simpson: Me three. What are we talking about?
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: Do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah. Easy.
Marge Simpson: You do love her, don't you?
Bart Simpson: (MUTTERS) Oh, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Well you do, don't you?
Bart Simpson: Don't make me say it. I know the answer, you know the answer, he knows the answer, let's just drop it. Okay?
Marge Simpson: Okay, Bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. Be nice to your sister.
Bart Simpson: Okey-dokey.
Marge Simpson: Go on, Bart. No time like the present.
(FOYER: int. foyer)
Bart Simpson: Hi, man.
Lisa Simpson: I don't want your pity.
Lisa Simpson: How?
Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Yeah! Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.
Bart Simpson: (THRU PHONE) Is Jacques there?
Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Who?
Bart Simpson: (THRU PHONE) Jacques. Last name Strap.
Moe Szyslak: Hold on. (CALLS OUT) Uh..Jacques Strap! Hey, guys, I'm looking for a Jacques Strap!
Barflies: (CHUCKLE)
Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) What -- oh! Wait a minute -- Jacques Strap? It's you, isn't it? You cowardly little runt. When I get hold of you I am gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house)
Bart Simpson: Where's your sense of humor, man?
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, you'll be late for band practice. Let's go.
(Noiseland Arcade: ext. video arcade - day)
Homer Simpson: Gimme some quarters. (COVERING) I'm doing my laundry.
Cashier: (OVER MICROPHONE; SARCASTIC) Yeah, right.
Homer Simpson: (LOW) Where's the video boxing?
Cashier: (OVER MICROPHONE) It's over there in the corner, but if I were you, I really would use those quarters for laundry.
Homer Simpson: (RE: CHAMP) Hey, that kid's pretty good.
Boy Onlooker: Good? Are you kidding? Over two thousand fights, and he's still on his original quarter.
Champ: Okay? Who's next?
Kids: (WAVING QUARTERS) Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!
Homer Simpson: (TOWERING OVER CROWD WITH HIS BAG OF QUARTERS) No, me! No, Me!
Homer Simpson: Listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do?
Champ: I don't think so.
Homer Simpson: Aw, come on.
Champ: I'll tell you what, I'll do it if you bark like a dog.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) You little... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
Champ: (LAUGHING) You got yourself a deal, Fido.
(Noiseland Arcade: int. arcade - sometime later)
Champ: Well, looks like you're all out of quarters, old man.
Homer Simpson: That's okay. With the tips you've given me, I'm going to pound the tar out of a certain little smarty pants tonight. (CHUCKLES)
Woman: (TO CHAMP) Howie! I thought I told you to stop wasting your money in this stupid place.
Champ: Uh-oh. Sorry, Mom.
Woman: And you! A man of your age! You should be ashamed of yourself!
Homer Simpson: Excuse me. I think I hear my wife calling.
(Marge's Car: int. marge's car - day)
Lisa Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT)
Marge Simpson: Now, Lisa, listen to me. This is important. I want you to smile today.
Lisa Simpson: But I don't feel like smiling.
Marge Simpson: Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. It's what shows up on the surface that counts. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you... and happiness will follow.
Marge Simpson: Come on. You can do better than that.
Marge Simpson: Ah, that's my girl.
Lisa Simpson: I feel more popular already.
(Springfield Elementary School Yard: ext. school yard - continuous)
Ralph Wiggum: Hey, nice smile.
Lisa Simpson: (BRAVELY) Thanks.
Stan: Hey! What are you talking to her for? She's just going to say something weird.
Lisa Simpson: (THROUGH CLENCHED SMILING TEETH) Not me.
Ralph Wiggum: You know, I used to think you were some sort of a brainiac, but... I guess you're okay.
Lisa Simpson: (THROUGH SMILE) Uh-huh.
Stan: Hey, why don't come over to my house after practice? You can do my homework.
Lisa Simpson: Okay.
Marge Simpson: (Murmurs OF annoyance)
Dewey Largo: Five minutes, people. Five minutes. Now, Miss Simpson, I hope we won't have a repeat of yesterday's outburst of unbridled... creativity.
Marge Simpson: (Murmur OF extreme annoyance)
Lisa Simpson: No, sir.
Lisa Simpson: Wow, Mom.
Dewey Largo: So that's where she gets it.
Marge Simpson: (TRULY DISTRAUGHT) Lisa, I apologize to you. I was wrong. I take it all back. Always be yourself. You want to be sad, honey, be sad. We'll ride it out with you. And when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. From now on, let me do the smiling for both of us.
Lisa Simpson: Okay, Mom.
Marge Simpson: I said you could stop smiling, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: I feel like smiling.
Bart Simpson: (BORED) I'm going to knock you out one more time and that's it. This is getting boring, man.
Homer Simpson: (COYLY) Just try not to kill me too hard, son. Heh-heh-heh.
Bart Simpson: Whoa!
Homer Simpson: Kid, tonight's not your night.
Bart Simpson: All right, man. You asked for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.
Homer Simpson: Oh! Oh! Block it.
Bart Simpson: Wha' the...
Homer Simpson: (GRUNT; CHUCKLE) Uh-oh. You missed me.
Homer Simpson: Ha ha! I got you. Don't try that. I got ya. I'll block you. (IMITATING RING ANNOUNCER) And the crowd is on its feet as Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill.
Marge Simpson: Boys, I'd like your attention, please.
Homer Simpson: Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment.
Homer Simpson: Bart-the-bloody-pulp Simpson is on the ropes. He's hoping I'll put him out of his misery. Well, you're in luck, Bart, here comes my right.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Oh, noooo!
Homer Simpson: My game! My game! I coulda beat the boy! Marge, how could you? I was so close.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game.
Bart Simpson: You're right, Mom. I'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing.
Homer Simpson: (EXASPERATED GRUNT)
Marge Simpson: Oh, calm down, Homer. Lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family.
(JAZZ HOLE NIGHTCLUB: int. jazz hole nightclub)
Bleeding Gums Murphy: This next song was written by a friend of mine, one of the great little ladies of jazz.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (SINGS) "I got this bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo."
Homer Simpson: What?
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (SINGS) "I'm the saddest kid in grade number two."
(Simpson Front Yard: EXT. SIMPSON'S FRONT YARD - SATURDAY MORNING)
Bart Simpson: (GRUNTS WITH EXERTION) Rusty old hunk of junk.
Rod Flanders: (VERY FRIENDLY) Howdy, Bart. Hot enough for ya?
Bart Simpson: (GRUMBLING TO HIMSELF) Shut up, Flanders. Hey dad, how come we can't get a decent mower like the Flanders?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Just be happy with what you got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanderses.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS)
Ned Flanders: How do you like my new wheels, Simpson?
Bart Simpson: (UNRESERVEDLY) Wow, man! What an RV!
Homer Simpson: Bart! (TO FLANDERS) I suppose it has..uh..various features?
NED: It's got everything! Microwave, dishwasher, big-screen TV, deep fryer, and... see up there on the roof?
Homer Simpson: (CROAKING) A satellite dish!
Ned Flanders: Yes indeedilly-doodily.
Homer Simpson: But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do.
Ned Flanders: Simple, Simpson. Credit.
Homer Simpson: Oooh! Credit.
(Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us): ext. bob's rv roundup (FORMERLY RVS Я US) - A LITTLE LATER)
Cowboy Bob: Thank you God. Heh, heh. (CLEARS THROAT) May I help you?
Marge Simpson: (QUICKLY) We're just browsing, thank you.
Homer Simpson: I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?
Cowboy Bob: Yes, I do. That would be... the Ultimate Behemoth.
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED) Where is it?
Marge Simpson: Homer.
Cowboy Bob: We're standing in its presence. Behold! Isn't she... Look at this thing...
Cowboy Bob: Can you believe it? Man built this. It's a vehicle.
Homer Simpson: (BABBLES SPEECHLESSLY)
Bart Simpson: Does it have its own satellite dish, sir?
Cowboy Bob: You can tell your son, it has its own satellite. The VanStar One launched last February, just for this thing. That's all.
Bart Simpson: Oh man!
Marge Simpson: I'm not sure that we can afford...
Homer Simpson: (EAGERLY) Does it have a deep fryer?
Cowboy Bob: It has four of them. One for each part of the chicken.
Marge Simpson: I don't think we can afford this, Homer.
Salesman: Let's worry about that later. C'mon let's take a tour. Want to? C'mon.
(INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH: int. inside the ultimate behemoth - continues)
Bart Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Aye carumba!
Lisa Simpson: This is better than our house!
Homer Simpson: Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED) It all seems so expensive...
Homer Simpson: Hey, how much is it?
Cowboy Bob: You're a man of convict... You just wanted to ask that and blurted it out. Didn't you?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, how much is it?
Cowboy Bob: Well, first of all, I want you to know, I like your face.
Homer Simpson: You do?
Cowboy Bob: Really. I really do. I'm not just saying that. I mean it. You've got color in there. You're not Roman are you?
Homer Simpson: No.
Cowboy Bob: You look like a God, sort of. Why don't we step into the credit office, Zeus? (CHUCKLING) Hey your dad's just gonna come in here and work it out. Then you'll drive home in this.
(INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE: int. inside credit office - a few minutes later)
Cowboy Bob: I'm not gonna quote you a price until I check your credit rating. Lemme. I want to make myself clear on this. This is a formality. If you're saying to me, Bob, is this guy good for it? I say, yes. I don't check this machine. But I don't own the place. Even though my name's up there. Long story. But that doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to run it through the computer.
Homer Simpson: Is that a good siren? Am I approved?
Cowboy Bob: You ever known a siren to be good? Ha! No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. It's a bad siren. That's the computer in case I went blind telling me, sell a vehicle to this fellow and you're out of business. That's what the siren says.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Cowboy Bob: It seems the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range. And wee bit is me being polite. You couldn't afford this thing if you lived to be a million.
Homer Simpson: Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? (SADLY) I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob.
Cowboy Bob: Take it easy there. Don't ruin this feeling I'm getting from you. Perhaps I can show you something a little more... you.
(BACK OF THE RV LOT: EXT. BACK OF THE RV LOT - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER)
Cowboy Bob: Well, what do you think?
Marge Simpson: Used, isn't it?
Cowboy Bob: Mr. Simpson, you're never gonna own a better RV. And I don't mean that in a good way. I mean literally, buddy, this is it for you. You know, it's this or a wagon.
Homer Simpson: How much do you want for it?
Cowboy Bob: This is for you? This is yours? The price I'm quoting you? You're not gonna hand it to someone else? 'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for you, not for someone else... someone else, I'm doubling this.
Homer Simpson: I swear it Bob.
Cowboy Bob: This is you and me?
Homer Simpson: Yeah!
Cowboy Bob: In other words, two months from now I see this vehicle, your head's in that window?
Homer Simpson: On my honor.
Cowboy Bob: Three-fifty a month.
Homer Simpson: Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be alright if I conferred with my family?
Cowboy Bob: Mr. Simpson, if you have to go talk it over with those humans out there, then, there's something wrong with all of us. You look like a man who is able to make a decision or I wouldn't be wasting my... See that man right over there?
Homer Simpson: Yeah!
Cowboy Bob: He's buying this. Did you know that?
Homer Simpson: No.
Cowboy Bob: Called me two minutes before you came in, said, 'Save the little one, I'm coming down'. Here he is. Now, do you want it or not?
Homer Simpson: All right. All right! I'll take it.
Cowboy Bob: Best decision you're ever gonna make. You're gonna... This is gonna change your life.

Homer Simpson: (SCOFFING) Pfft. Maps. (SNORTS)
Marge Simpson: Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions?
Homer Simpson: Don't worry. This is an all-terrain vehicle.
Marge Simpson: My feet are getting wet!
Homer Simpson: Ah, come on. We're going back to nature.

Bart Simpson: You mean like we just did?
Homer Simpson: (RE MAGGIE) Will somebody help her?
Lisa Simpson: Look, Maggie! Birdies!
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer. What are we going to do?
Homer Simpson: Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
(The Girls' Campsite: ext. the girls' campsite - continuous)
DOLPH: Five finger discount, man.
Homer Simpson: Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings.
Homer Simpson: (SADLY TO HIMSELF) What am I going to do? I've murdered us all.
Homer's Canyon Echo: (LOUDLY) I've murdered us all... us all.. us all... us all.

Homer Simpson: Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax.
Lisa Simpson: (CALLING AFTER THEM) Remember, Dad. The handle of the Big Dipper points to the North Star.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods.
Lisa Simpson: Should Maggie be going with them, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Oh, I don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands, Lisa.
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS) There aren't any dangerous animals in this forest are there, Dad?
Homer Simpson: Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.
Bart Simpson: It's a deal.
Homer Simpson: And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Bart Simpson: (WORRIED) Right.
Homer Simpson: (PANIC) A rattler!
Bart Simpson: (PETRIFIED) I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not...
Homer Simpson: Run, you fool!

Homer Simpson: Through here, boy. Back to civilization.
Bart Simpson: How do you know?
Homer Simpson: When you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. It becomes natural. Like a third sense.

Homer Simpson: Plemk heh feh.
Newsman: (OVER CURSES) Now the naturalist who took these absolutely extraordinary pictures was most impressed by the creature's uncivilized look, its foul language, and most of all its indescribable stench.
Newsman: A popular supermarket tabloid has offered a reward of $5,000 to anyone who brings in the creature alive. Naturally, we'll have more on this story as soon as it develops. We now return you to the President's address, already in progress.

Homer Simpson: Can I have some apple sauce?
Tv Announcer #2: Specialists from around the world have gathered at the Springfield Primate Institute for a firsthand examination of the controversial creature. They are now ready to announce their findings.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished colleagues, after extensive biological and anatomical testing, I regret to announce that the evidence we have is inconclusive. This... thing may or may not be human.

Homer Simpson: Oh no, no. We stink, we stink!
Marge Simpson: Homer! Were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over?

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: And now I'd like to begin today's sermon which I have entitled, "Gambling, the 8th Deadly Sin." Today is Sunday, the Lord's day and yet, at this very moment, millions of Americans are not in the Lord's house. They're in their own house worshipping a false idol, professional football. Oh Lord...

Marge Simpson: No! Look, I don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids. Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in Sunday school today?
Lisa Simpson: The answers to deep theological questions..
Bart Simpson: Yeah. Among other things, apes can't get into heaven.
Homer Simpson: What! Those cute little monkeys? That's terrible. Who told you that?
Bart Simpson: Our teacher.
Homer Simpson: I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?
Bart Simpson: Ah, cool, man. Space Mutants 4. Drop me off! Drop me off!
Marge Simpson: No way, Jose.

Homer Simpson: You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... (GASP) Oh, oh.
C. Montgomery Burns: Look, there it is! The head!
Krusty the Clown: Kill him!
(Street: EXT. STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT)
Krusty the Clown: We know this part.
Bart Simpson: Oh yeah, right...
(Park: ext. park)
Bart Simpson: Well, that's my story. And if you still want to tear apart this young Sunday school student as he stands on the brink of salvation, I await your wrath.
Mob: Oohhh!
Krusty the Clown: Somehow I don't feel like killing anymore.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Neither do I.
Bart Simpson: Dad?
Bart Simpson: Forgive me, sir.
Jebediah Springfield: No problem, Bart.
Seymour Skinner: Look. It's glorious
Otto Mann: It's beautiful, man.
C. Montgomery Burns: I love you, Smithers.

Lisa Simpson: Maybe one more.
Lisa Simpson: I hope she likes the presents we got her.
Patty Bouvier: (LOW) Do you know the Heimlich Maneuver?
Bart Simpson: Well, I know she'll like mine. Who wouldn't like a bottle of real French perfume?
Bart Simpson: All the way from Gay Paree. Four bucks, plus tax.
Lisa Simpson: Well, I think she's gonna like my hand-made birthday card better.
Bart Simpson: Whoa, big deal... dry macaroni... spray paint and glue. Whoopee!
Bart Simpson: (WHISTLES)
Bart Simpson: Dibs! First dibs, I get to lick the beaters.

Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Huh? Whuh?
Lisa Simpson: Here's your birthday breakfast!
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED) Well, isn't this nice?
Homer Simpson: My birthday?
Lisa Simpson: No!
Homer Simpson: It's my birthday? What did I get? I love birthdays.
Marge Simpson: (A LITTLE COLDLY) No, Homer. It's mine.
Bart Simpson: You don't even know your own wife's birthday?
Homer Simpson: (PANIC RAPIDLY SETTING IN) Of course I know! Sure! (TO MARGE) You really thought I forgot, didn't you?
Bart Simpson: Oh, right. What'd you get her, Dad?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, what'd you get?
Homer Simpson: (STALLING) Huh... a very thoughtful gift. But it's a surprise. (STRETCHING) You know, it's such a beautiful morning, I think I'll take a little stroll around the block.
Lisa Simpson: I think he forgot, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Umm-hmm.
(Springfield Mall: ext. SPRINGFIELD mall - a few minutes later)

Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) Oh, Marge. He never gets you anything you want. He always gets something for himself.
Selma Bouvier: (TO PATTY) Like the tackle box.
Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) Remember when he got you the tackle box?
Selma Bouvier: (TO PATTY) And Connie Chung.
Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) And when he "surprised" you with the Connie Chung calendar?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) I'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.

Selma Bouvier: Umm-hmm.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - foyer - a little later)
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Be right there.
Marge Simpson: Homer, we're having dinner tonight at the Singing Sirloin.

Bart Simpson: You're welcome, Mom.
Patty Bouvier: (TO MARGE) Thirty-four years old.
Selma Bouvier: (LOW, TO MARGE) Time enough to start over with a new man.
Patty Bouvier: (LOW, TO MARGE) Someone who eats with his mouth shut.
Homer Simpson: What's that, Patty?
Patty Bouvier: Nothing. Finish your steak. (LOW) Look at him wolf down that gristle.
Barney Gumble: Wow!
Bart Simpson: Does not.
Lisa Simpson: Does, too.
Bart Simpson: Does not.
Lisa Simpson: Then how comes she's not putting on any of your perfume?
Bart Simpson: Yeah. Hey, Mom. How come you're not putting on any of my perfume?
Marge Simpson: Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) I-I'm saving it... for a special occasion.
Bart Simpson: What the hell are you talking about? There's gallons of it.
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: But this occasion is already so special if we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special.
Bart Simpson: Gotcha. (TO LISA) I told you she liked mine better.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, brother.
Homer Simpson: (AMIABLY) Hold on! Hold on now! Your mother hasn't opened my present yet.

Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Whoop! Don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. Beauty, isn't she?
Marge Simpson: Well, it's hard for me to judge (ANGRILY) since I've never bowled in my life.
Homer Simpson: (PLAYFUL) Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does.
(Simpson Master Bedroom: INT. Marge & homer's BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT)
Homer Simpson: You always say we should talk. I'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. But I'm going to stop in a second. So, please say something back, Marge, please. I'm gonna stop talking... now.
Marge Simpson: You bought that bowling ball for you, not for me.
Homer Simpson: What? No...
Marge Simpson: The holes were drilled for your fingers.
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could I?
Marge Simpson: You never intended for me to use that ball.
Homer Simpson: Well, if that's how you feel, I'll take it back.
Marge Simpson: You can't take it back. You had your name engraved on it.
Homer Simpson: So you'd know it's from me!
Marge Simpson: (GRIM) Homer, I'm keeping the ball. For myself.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm. I'll just use my ball.
Homer Simpson: (TAKEN ABACK) What? But you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.
Marge Simpson: (GRIM) I'm keeping it and I'm going to use it. Thank you for the present, Homer.

Counter Guy: Over there.
Marge Simpson: Thank you.
Counter Guy: Hey, wait, wait a minute. You're gonna need a lane.
Marge Simpson: No, thanks. I'm just here out of spite.
Counter Guy: Can't bowl without a lane.
Marge Simpson: Hm. Well... all right.
Counter Guy: Okay, here you go. You keep score on this. What size shoes you wear?
Marge Simpson: (PRIMLY) Never you mind.
Counter Guy: (PATIENT) Can't wear street shoes on the lanes. You gotta wear bowling shoes. What size, please?
Marge Simpson: (SOFTLY) Thirteen. Double A.
Counter Guy: Thirteen double A. (WHISTLES)
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Counter Guy: This is the closest I've got.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)

Marge Simpson: (TO HERSELF) A little warm and moist. (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR)
Jacques: (TO GROUPIES; THICK ACCENT) So -- one hundred and twenty pins later, I am the better man.
Marge Simpson: (TO HERSELF) I don't see what he's doing that's so different from what I'm doing.
Marge Simpson: (EMBARRASSED) Oh!
Marge Simpson: I'm awfully sorry.
Jacques: Entirely my fault. (PAUSE) It is nice to meet you... (LOOKS AT HER BALL)... Homer.
Marge Simpson: (FLUSTERED) Oh, no, no. Homer is my... ball's name. I'm Marge.
Marge Simpson: (SLIGHT SURPRISED GASP)
Jacques: Your fingers are so slender, so feminine. They are far too tapered for the ball you are using. You need something lighter, more delicate. Here, use my ball.
Marge Simpson: No... no, thank you, Mr... uh... (LOOKS AT THE NAME ON HIS BALL)... Brunswick.
Jacques: Call me Jacques.
Marge Simpson: Jacques.
Jacques: Marge.
Jacques: (PHILOSOPHICAL) As you wish. Many people have senseless attachments to heavy, clumsy things such as this "Homer" of yours.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm.
Jacques: May I ask you a bold question?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Jacques: You've never bowled before?
Marge Simpson: Never.
Jacques: No?
Marge Simpson: No.
Jacques: Then I will teach you.
Marge Simpson: Oh, I don't want to trouble you.
Jacques: Not at all. I am a professional. Roll the ball for me, Marge. Let me see your form.
Marge Simpson: All right. But I'm not very good.
Marge Simpson: I can hit that one pin all right. But the rest of them don't even wobble.
Jacques: I can help you, Marge. Pick up the ball. Pick up Homer. Pick him up.
Marge Simpson: Oh!
Jacques: Now, throw!
Marge Simpson: But...
Jacques: Throw, damn you!
Marge Simpson: (GASPS) You're a very good teacher!
Jacques: Yes, I am a very good teacher and I can teach you everything. I can tell you what the little arrows on the wood floor mean. Which frame is the beer frame. I bet you don't know how to make a five-seven-ten split, do you, Marge?
Marge Simpson: No.
Jacques: But first of all, you yell.. the eight pin is a cop.
Marge Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Jacques: Let it out, Marge. Laugh loud. Laugh out loud. You'll lose weight.
Marge Simpson: Oh, that's very funny.
Jacques: Feels good.
Marge Simpson: Oh, dear, I didn't realize there was so much to this game. What do you charge for lessons?
Jacques: (LIKE CHARLES BOYER) Twenty-five dollars.
Marge Simpson: Twenty-five dollars!
Jacques: It's a forty-dollar value.
Marge Simpson: Oh. Well... all right. When do we start?
Jacques: We have already begun.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - continuous)
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) Now this is living, eh, kids? Hot pizza... the food of kings.
Eugene Fisk: I love you, Dad.
Lisa Simpson: Don't be scared, Dad. It's not so hard taking care of us.
Homer Simpson: (LAUGHS) Lisa, I'm not scared. I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. (LONG BEAT AS THEY EAT) Does the time always drag like this?
(Barney's Bowlarama: int. bowling alley - continuous)
Jacques: (SENSUOUS) First you must get to know your lane. Feel the slickness. Feel the satiny finish. Caress it. Experience it. Quite smooth, isn't it?
Marge Simpson: Hm, very smooth.
Jacques: Smooth?
Marge Simpson: Yes, very.
Jacques: Yes?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Jacques: Yes.
Marge Simpson: Smooth.
Jacques: Smooth?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Jacques: Yes. You could eat off of it.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm.
Jacques: You hungry?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Jacques: (CALLING OFFSTAGE) Four onion rings!
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - a little later)
Lisa Simpson: Mm! Delicioso!
Bart Simpson: (LICKING HIS FINGERS) My compliments to the delivery boy.
Homer Simpson: Okay. We've eaten, and eaten well. Now, what else do we have to do? Well, let's check the list your mom left us.
Homer Simpson: Eat, mm-hm.
Homer Simpson: Ooh. Clean up. Now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in.
Homer Simpson: All right, we're clean. Now we'll... (CHECKS LIST) put Maggie to bed.

Homer Simpson: (HALF ASLEEP) Ahhh... ahhh... Oh, how was bowling?
Marge Simpson: It's a very challenging hobby.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES SLEEPILY) Sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing.
Marge Simpson: Umm-hmm. But I think I'll do much better tomorrow night.
Homer Simpson: Oh? You're going back?
(Kwik-E-Mart: ext. Kwik-E-Mart)
Marge Simpson: Well, sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again?
Homer Simpson: (CONFUSED) Uh, no, I don't mind.
Marge Simpson: Good night, Homer.
Homer Simpson: 'Night.
(Barney's Bowlarama: int. bowling alley - next night)
Jacques: It is for you.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Jacques! It fits. You got it in my size and it has my name on it. It's really for me.
Jacques: Seventeen fifty. Enjoy it my darling.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - late that night)
Jacques: (HUMMING) Here we are.
Marge Simpson: You didn't have to drop me off.
Jacques: But I wanted to. Marge... Do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight?
Marge Simpson: Oh, Jacques, I'm a married woman.
Jacques: (TORTURED) I know, I know. My mind says stop, but my heart and my hips cry proceed.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Jacques: Marge, darling, I-I want to see you tomorrow. Not at Barney's Bowl-A-Rama. Away from the thunderous folly of clattering pins. Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
Marge Simpson: What's brunch?
Jacques: You'd love it. It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end. You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal.
Marge Simpson: I don't think so.
Jacques: Marge, darling, there are ten pins in my heart. You've knocked over eight. Won't you please pick up that spare?
Marge Simpson: (A-FLUTTER) Oh! Oh! (QUICKLY) Well, all right.
Homer Simpson: Marge?
Marge Simpson: What, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (DEFEATED) Nothing.
(Simpson Foyer: int. simpson foyer - morning)
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh. School bus.
Marge Simpson: Here you go, kids. Special lunches. Lots of good things for growing bodies and some treats just for fun.
Bart Simpson: Whoa. Aye carumba!
Lisa Simpson: Are you going bowling again tonight, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Hm, yes, I am, as a matter of fact. Here's more treats. But don't worry, your dad will take care of dinner.
Bart Simpson: Mmm. Wednesday -- hoagie night.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Lisa. My darling little Lisa.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Bart. My special little guy.
(School Bus: int. school bus)
Bart Simpson: Mmmm. Great lunches, eh, Lis?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, Bart, don't you see? This is what psychologists call over-compensation. Mom is racked with guilt because her marriage is failing.
Bart Simpson: Hey, don't rock the boat, man. Whatever it is, we're making out like bandits.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I read about what happens to kids whose parents no longer love and cherish each other. They go through eight separate stages. Right now, I'm in Stage Three, fear. You're in Stage Two, denial.
Bart Simpson: No, I'm not.
Lisa Simpson: Yes, you are.
Bart Simpson: No, I'm not.
Lisa Simpson: Yes, you are.
Bart Simpson: Am not, am not, am not!
Lisa Simpson: (A LITTLE FRIGHTENED) I stand corrected.
(Coffee Shop: int. coffee shop - brunch time)
Jacques: Mimosa?
Marge Simpson: I'm a married woman. Please don't call me that.
Jacques: (LAUGHING) No, no, no, no, no. Mimosa is the name of the drink. It's orange juice and champagne. You're so wonderful that you thought it was something offensive.
Marge Simpson: Oh. Well, thank you.
HELEN: Marge! Marge Simpson! You remember me, don't you? I'm Helen Lovejoy, the gossipy wife of the minister.
Marge Simpson: Oh... yes, hello, Helen.
HELEN: Well, I had just finished eating and was about to leave when I looked over this way and said to myself, "Why, isn't that Marge Simpson over there? Having brunch with a man who isn't her husband?" And I just had to come over and say hello.
Marge Simpson: We're... uh...
HELEN: Oh, don't squirm on my account.
Jacques: I am giving her a bowling lesson, thank you.
Jacques: Now, Marge. Uh, the pins on the three-seven-ten split would be here. We'll make this little piece of food the ball. The ball's bigger, you know that...
Marge Simpson: Hmm-hmm.
Jacques: But for food, this is a good ball.
HELEN: Well, 'bye-bye. See you in church on Sunday, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Helen.
Jacques: Goodbye, Helen.
Mr. Fisk: I love you, son.
Jacques: You have a lovely friend, there. Let's hope something runs over her.
Marge Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Jacques: Your laughter is like music to me. But if you laugh at what I say next I will die, for I am about to say something very serious... perhaps shocking. Marge, my darling, I want you to meet with me again.
Marge Simpson: That doesn't shock me.
Jacques: Away from prying eyes. Away from the Helens of the world. At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace.
Jacques: (LIKE "THE CONTINENTAL") I've been waiting for you. Come in, my captivating one.
Jacques: May I have this dance?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Marge Simpson: You certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
Jacques: (LAUGHING) I like you so much. They're not for bowling. You are so naive. They're for lovemaking.
Marge Simpson: Really!?
Jacques: Yes... Champagne?
Marge Simpson: Please.
Jacques: There, my darling.
Marge Simpson: Thank you.
Jacques: What cosmic force brought us together, Marge?
Marge Simpson: Destiny?
Jacques: Yes... Some divine pin-spotter must have placed us side by side.
Marge Simpson: Like two fragile bowling pins...
Jacques: Standing bravely...
Marge Simpson: Until inevitably...
Jacques: We must topple.
Jacques: Marge, speak to me.
Marge Simpson: Is Thursday okay?
Jacques: It's okay indeed.
(Simpson Home: int. Simpson house - master bedroom - early evening)
Homer Simpson: For Marge?
Bart Simpson: (CHEERY) Hey, Dad. What do you say we toss the ol' apple around, huh? Sound like fun?
Homer Simpson: (EXHAUSTED) Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball.
Bart Simpson: Aw, come on, Dad. Get the lead out.
(YARD: ext. yard - early evening)
Bart Simpson: Simpson checks the runner on first. He's cool. He's fine. Here's the windup and... here's the pitch.
Bart Simpson: Dad, you didn't even say ouch.
Homer Simpson: Oh, sorry... ouch!
Bart Simpson: Lisa, Lisa! I think you're right about Dad. Something's very, very wrong here.
Lisa Simpson: Frightened, Bart? Welcome to Stage Three: Fear.
Bart Simpson: Well, come on. We gotta do something, man.
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, Bart. I'd love to help you but I'm mired in Stage Five, self-pity.
Bart Simpson: Look, Dad. I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some advice that might help.
Homer Simpson: I gave you advice? Get outta here.
Bart Simpson: Yeah. You did! You told me when something's bothering you, and you're too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut. At least that way you won't make things worse.
Homer Simpson: Hmm. Good advice.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - thursday morning)
Homer Simpson: (STRUGGLING FOR THE RIGHT WORDS) Marge, may I speak to you?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Homer Simpson: You know, I've been thinking... Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. But your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. I don't know how you do it. You've just got a gift, I guess. I've always thought so. I just never mentioned it. But it's time you knew how I feel. I don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. (BROKEN) ...Goodbye, my wife.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Homer.
(Jacques's Apartment: int. jacques' apartment)

Marge Simpson: So how was the office birthday party?
Homer Simpson: Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was (INDICATING WITH FINGERS) this thick. (CHUCKLES) And Eugene Fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. And he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance.
Marge Simpson: Does this girl like him?
Homer Simpson: Pffft. I have to warn you, Marge -- I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Just keepin' you on your toes, babe.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds?! (MOAN) I'm a blimp! Why are all the good things so tasty? From now on, exercise every morning.

Homer Simpson: Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance.
Marge Simpson: Homer, is this some kind of stag party?
Homer Simpson: No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing.
Marge Simpson: Eugene Fisk? Isn't he your assistant?
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) No, my supervisor.

Female Mail Carrier: (SIMULTANEOUS WITH ABOVE) Where's my spy camera? Every day for the last six months. Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera? Here's your stupid spy camera!

Martin Prince: Bart, I'd really appreciate a print of your masterwork.

C. Montgomery Burns: What in blue blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: What do you mean, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: I mean this!
C. Montgomery Burns: A plant employee carrying on like an oversexed orangutan in heat! This is a family nuclear-power plant, Simpson. Our research indicates that over 50 percent of our power is used by women. I will not have you offending my customers with your bawdy shenanigans!
Homer Simpson: It won't happen again, sir. I promise. May I get out of your sight now?
C. Montgomery Burns: Just a second, Simpson! Smithers, would you leave the room for a minute?
Waylon Smithers: Yes, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led a solitary life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, a certain... how shall I put it? Animal magnetisme. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret.
Homer Simpson: Uh... Mr. Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover-boy.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, I'm asking you nicely.

Homer Simpson: Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton. (BREAKING DOWN) Come on, Marge. Please forgive me? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Marge Simpson: Homer! You don't even know why you're apologizing.
Homer Simpson: Yes I do. Because I'm (PITIFULLY) hungry... my clothes are smelly... and I'm tired.
Marge Simpson: I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very bad lesson. Your boy idolizes you.
Homer Simpson: Oh, he does not!
Marge Simpson: Yes he does, Homer. And when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. You owe your son better than that, Homer.
Homer Simpson: So what should I do, Marge?
Marge Simpson: Well, I think you should take Bart to meet this exotic belly-person. I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her.
Homer Simpson: Okay. Your wish is my command, my little...

Homer Simpson: Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object.
Princess Kashmir: Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson: I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. I want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings, too.
Princess Kashmir: Oh, okay, but can we make it quick?
Bart Simpson: Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Homer Simpson: Could you tell him a little about yourself?

C. Montgomery Burns: You, with the hair. Down in front!
Marge Simpson: Oh, he's sunk even lower!
Homer Simpson: Quiet! I have something to say to all the sons out there; to all the boys; to all the men; to all of us. It's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. No, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews -- well, not our nephews -- they are our mothers. And you know something, folks? As ridiculous as it sounds, I would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as I sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string. Am I wrong, or am I right?

Adil Hoxha: (IN ALBANIAN) And I will miss you, but now I must go.
Seymour Skinner: Hello, Mrs. Simpson. I'm afraid there's been a very disturbing incident at school today.
Bart Simpson: I'm outta here, man.
Marge Simpson: Homer, Principal Skinner's here.
Homer Simpson: Oh, hello Principal Skinner. I'd get up but the boy crippled me.
Seymour Skinner: Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) That old gag.
Seymour Skinner: Unfortunately, at the same moment, my mother was in the girls' lavatory making use of the facilities.
Marge Simpson: Oh, dear.
Seymour Skinner: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible. I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick. I think it behooves us all to consider... deportation.
Marge Simpson: (AGHAST) Deportation! You mean kick Bart out of the country?
Homer Simpson: Hear him out, Marge.
Seymour Skinner: Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Now normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big exception. And, if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away.
Homer Simpson: Sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months.
Marge Simpson: Homer! You didn't even ask where Bart would be going.
Seymour Skinner: Actually, he'd be staying in France in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine country.
Marge Simpson: But Bart doesn't speak French.
Seymour Skinner: Oh! When he's totally immersed in a foreign language, the average child can become fluent in weeks.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, but what about Bart?
Seymour Skinner: I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And the whole thing won't cost you a dime as long you're willing to take in a student of your own.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam you are?
Seymour Skinner: Well, for one thing, you wouldn't be getting a French boy. You would be getting an Albanian.
Homer Simpson: You mean all white with pink eyes?
Seymour Skinner: No, no, no, no. A student from Albania. It's a country on the Adriatic Sea.
Marge Simpson: Well, going to France sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but I think Bart should have a say in this.
(Bart's Bedroom: int. bart's bedroom)
Bart Simpson: Aah, the life of a frog. That's the life for me.
Marge Simpson: Bart, how would you like to spend the next three months living in France?
Bart Simpson: France? Wow.
(LIVING ROOM: int. living room)
Homer Simpson: He makes me crazy twelve months a year. At least you get the summer off.
Seymour Skinner: Mmm-hmm.
Bart Simpson: And I'd get to take a plane there, wouldn't I, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Yes, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Wow. And one back?
Marge Simpson: Mmm-hmm. Well, Bart seems very enthusiastic about the idea.
Marge Simpson: Yes! Yes!
Seymour Skinner: Way to go!
Homer Simpson: Bon voyage, boy.

Bart Simpson: I know I'm going and you're not.
Homer Simpson: I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room.
Bart Simpson: Okay, Dad.

In this way, and only in this way, can we hope to better understand our backward neighbors throughout the world.
Adil Hoxha: Thank you, Principal Skinner. Thank you, fellow students. (BECOMING SLIGHTLY SINISTER) Although I have only been in your country a few days, I have already found Americans to be most... trusting.

Lisa Simpson: I'm defending a country where people can think and act and worship any way they want.
Adil Hoxha: Can not.
Lisa Simpson: Can, too.
Adil Hoxha: Can not.
Lisa Simpson: Can, too.
Homer Simpson: Please, please kids. Stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being a land of opportunity, and maybe Adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers.
Adil Hoxha: Your father is right. We should not fight. Friends?
Lisa Simpson: Well, okay.
Marge Simpson: Well, now that that's settled, I'll just clear the dishes.
Adil Hoxha: No, no, Mrs. Simpson. You have been oppressed enough for today. I will clear the dishes.
Marge Simpson: Oh. Okay.
Homer Simpson: Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Lisa Simpson: Your paper-thin commitment to your children sends shivers down my spine. May I be excused?
Marge Simpson: Lisa!
Homer Simpson: Oh, she's just jealous. She'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her. (LAUGHS)

UGOLIN: Now, go to sleep.
Bart Simpson: Hey! Hey! Come on. Move it, pal.
Cesar: You leave Maurice alone. The floor is good enough for you. You go to sleep there.

Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aww. You called me dad.
Adil Hoxha: Dad, do you think I could come visit you at the nuclear power plant?
Homer Simpson: You want to see where I work?
Adil Hoxha: Oh, yes, very much.
Homer Simpson: (SNIFFLES) None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.
Adil Hoxha: Then I can go?
Homer Simpson: Well, I'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in Security, but sure, you bet.
Adil Hoxha: (TENTING FINGERS) Excellent.
(VINEYARDS: ext. vineyards)
Cesar: Now watch me. (DEMONSTRATING) You grab the grape between your thumb and forefinger and gently twist it off and drop it in the bucket.
Cesar: Now you do it.

Homer Simpson: Sector Twelve?

Cesar: (IN FRENCH) Silence!
Marge Simpson: Everyone here in the United States is fine. We think Maggie may say her first word any day now. Lisa got an A in Math, which I'm only mentioning as news -- I'm not putting you down. And your father, well... last night he went to sleep talking about how much he loves you.

UGOLIN: Prison? Oh, my. (IN FRENCH: En prison? Oh, non!)
Lisa Simpson: Hi, Sideshow Bob.
Cesar: (CHUCKLING) Whenever I find my faith in a higher power shaken, I always think of the miracle of anti-freeze. Too much can be poison. (POURING SOME IN) But the right amount gives wine just the right kick. (IN FRENCH: Quand je sens que ma foi dans les forces supremes faiblit, je pense toujours au miracle de l'antigel. Si on en met trop, blen sur, c'est du poison. (POURING) Mais dans les proportions voulues, ca donne du corps au vin.)
UGOLIN: You put in too much. It may kill someone. (IN FRENCH: Je pense que tu en par trop. Tu vas tuer quelqu'un avec ca.)
Cesar: Kill someone? Don't be ridiculous. (IN FRENCH: Tuer quelqu'un? T'es fou!)
Cesar: What are you doing? Get out of here.

Cesar: On second thought, Bart, Bart, come here. (TO UGOLIN) Watch, I bet it won't even blind him. (IN FRENCH: Regarde. Je te parie que ca va meme pas le rendre aveugie.)
Cesar: Drink this.
Bart Simpson: Uh, no thanks.
Cesar: Do not worry. This is France. It is customary for children to take a little wine now and then.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, but it's got anti-freeze in there.
Cesar: Drink it!
Bart Simpson: (BURPS)
Cesar: (TO UGOLIN) He sees well enough. Now, go buy a case of anti-freeze. (IN FRENCH: Qu'est ce que je t'avais dit? Maintenant, va nous chercher une caisse d'antigel au magasin.)
UGOLIN: But it is raining outside. Let's make the wine tomorrow. (IN FRENCH: Mais il pleut. Est qu'on peut attendre et faire le vin demair?)

These two guys I'm staying with work me night and day, they don't feed me, they make me sleep on the floor, they put anti-freeze in the wine, and they gave my red hat to the donkey.)

Cia Agent #1: Mmm-hmm. Through the use of radio triangulation, we tracked him to exactly this point.
Homer Simpson: Wow!
Cia Agent #1: That's all I can tell you.
Homer Simpson: Aw!

Marge Simpson: Homer, I'd love a glass of that wine Bart brought us.

Krusty the Clown: Or do you want me to shoot Sideshow Bob out of a cannon? (LAUGHS)
Sideshow Bob: (BLOWS HIS WHISTLE DOWN)
Lisa Simpson: (CHANTING) The cannon. The cannon. The cannon. The cannon.
Brittany: The cannon.
Krusty the Clown: (SHRUGS) Sorry Sideshow Bob, but it's her special birthday wish.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHING) You're doomed, Sideshow Bob.
Krusty the Clown: I know we haven't had much luck shooting you out of this cannon, but maybe that's because we haven't used enough gun powder!
Krusty the Clown: Brittany, do the honors.
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGH) Don't blame me --
Lisa Simpson: I didn't do it!

Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... (GASPS) New flavor! Triple chocolate!
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: What's the matter, sir? Never have I seen you look so unhappy while purchasing such a large quantity of ice cream.
Homer Simpson: The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, "the gruesome twosome." (CHUCKLES)
Krusty the Clown: Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy....
Homer Simpson: (TURNING AROUND) Sorry, pal...

Scott Christian: The news story behind that enigmatic half-joke right after this commercial message.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. Bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?
Bart Simpson: Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?

Scott Christian: And just in... actual footage of the crime taken with the Kwik-E-Mart security camera.

Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer.
Patty Bouvier: So, the truth comes out.
Krusty the Clown: Hand over all your money in a paper bag.
Bart Simpson: Oh... oh! Krusty, how could you?
Marge Simpson: I know it looks very bad, honey -- but who knows? Maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along.

Krusty the Clown: Buy my cereal. (LAUGHS)
Krusty the Clown: I didn't do it.
Bart Simpson: I wish I could believe you.
Kent Brockman: Good evening again, Springfield. Krusty the Clown, the beloved idol of countless tots, now nothing more than a common alleged criminal. His trial, which begins tomorrow, has taken center ring in a national media circus as children of all ages, from eight to eighty, hang on each new development like so many Rumanian trapeze artists.
Kent Brockman: From his humble beginnings as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi...
Kent Brockman: Krusty clowned his way to the top of a personal mini-empire --
Kent Brockman: -- with dozens of endorsements, including his own line of pork products. This may have led to one of television's best-loved bloopers -- Krusty's near fatal on-the-air heart attack in 1986.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, son. You'll understand one day.
(Moe's Tavern: INT. MOE'S TAVERN)
Krusty the Clown: Wasn't that a great Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, kids? Well, we've got another one coming right up, but first I got a hankerin' for some pork products.
Krusty the Clown: Mmmm. Look! Plump succulent sausage, honey-smoked bacon and glistening, sizzling...(GASPING SOUND)
Krusty the Clown: I'm dying! I'm dying!
Kent Brockman: But a quick triple bypass and a pacemaker later, Krusty bounced back. However, he was a changed clown. Where his show had been condemned by parents and educators alike as simple-minded TV mayhem...
Kent Brockman: This new Krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping out illiteracy in today's anything-for-a- thrill youth.
Krusty the Clown: Give a hoot! Read a book!
Kent Brockman: Krusty's arrest has sent shock waves through Springfield, packing its churches, synagogues and mosques with disillusioned citizenry from all walks of life.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I urge every halfway decent member of our community to gather up all merchandise that bears the likeness of Krusty, that clown prince of corruption, and join me in a public burning.
Kent Brockman: So is Krusty the Clown about to trade in his baggy pants for the relatively snug uniform of Springfield Penitentiary? We'll find out tomorrow when his trial begins.

Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS) Uh... I mean, not guilty. Opening night jitters, your honor.
District Attorney: I would like to call to the stand, Homer J. Simpson.
Bart Simpson: Don't do it, Dad. Please don't do it.
Bart Simpson: He's innocent, I tell you. Krusty would never do something like that. Ah come on Dad, you gotta listen to me.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
District Attorney: Mr. Simpson, was that you taking that cowardly dive into that display of heavily-salted snack treats?
Homer Simpson: Yes, sir.
District Attorney: Hmmm hmmm. Do you recognize the gunman in this courtroom today?
Homer Simpson: Yes, I do.
District Attorney: Fine, would you point him out to us?
Homer Simpson: Okay.

(Courtroom: int. courtroom)
District Attorney: Krusty, would you please turn your attention to Exhibit B, and tell me what you see?

Krusty the Clown: (PITIFULLY) Uh... uh...
District Attorney: What's the matter, can't you read?
Krusty the Clown: (BREAKING DOWN INTO TEARS) No, I can't! I can't read or write! I admit it! I'm totally illiterate! Now are you happy?
Judge Snyder: (TO KRUSTY) Can it be that the champion of child literacy can't even read himself?
Krusty the Clown: Is it a crime to be illiterate?
Bart Simpson: So?
Bart Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, Al. Last name, Koholic.
District Attorney: All right, all right. See this, Krusty? This is a 'B'. And this is Exhibit B. Betting slips, obtained by this court indicating you have lost substantial sums of money on sports gambling --
Krusty the Clown: Is it a crime to bet on sporting events?
District Attorney: Yes, it is.
Krusty the Clown: Oh.
Judge Snyder: Foreperson, have you reached a verdict?
Foreperson: Yes, we have, your honor. We find the defendant, Krusty the Clown... guilty.

Sideshow Bob: My young friends. For years I have been silent, save for the crude glissandos of this primitive wind instrument. But now destiny has thrust me into the center ring. In the coming weeks, you will notice some rather sweeping changes in our program. Please, do not be alarmed. Itchy and Scratchy will still have a home here, but we will also learn about nutrition, self-esteem, etiquette and all the lively arts.
Bart Simpson: What the hell are you doing, Lis?
Lisa Simpson: I'm watching Sideshow Bob. You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Krusty used to be.
Bart Simpson: You backstabber, you traitor, you...
Lisa Simpson: (SLAPS BART IN THE FACE) Snap out of it, Bart. Face the facts. All those hours we spent staring at Krusty, we were staring at a crook.
Bart Simpson: Look, Lisa, I know Krusty's innocent. Don't ask me why. It's just a feeling I have.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Come on, Lisa. I think I can prove Krusty's innocent, but I need your help.
Lisa Simpson: You do? Why?
Bart Simpson: Oh, come on Lis, you know why.
Lisa Simpson: No, why?
Bart Simpson: (RELUCTANTLY) I'll never forgive you for making me say this, but... you're smarter than me.

Lisa Simpson: Don't you remember the get-well card we sent to Krusty? It was after his heart attack, when he had a pacemaker put in.
Bart Simpson: Ah ha!
Lisa Simpson: Wait a minute. Krusty can't read.
Bart Simpson: (CRACKING) Okay! okay! So the poor guy can't read! Can't we get off his back already?
Lisa Simpson: No! Don't you get it, Bart? How could Krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Hey, hey. This is not a lending library. If you're not going to buy that thing, put it down or I'll blow your heads off.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I'm starting to think you're right. Krusty was framed. Did he have any enemies?
Bart Simpson: I don't know, but I know someone who would: Krusty's best friend in the whole world, Sideshow Bob.

Sideshow Bob: (CHUCKLING) Certainly. I take great pride in being able to sign my own name.
Bart Simpson: Sideshow Bob, can we ask you a few--
Sideshow Bob: Forgive me, children. As much as Sideshow Bob would love to chat, he has a show starting in moments. Here you go. Three tickets, be my guest.
Bart Simpson: (RELUCTANTLY) Well, okay, but...
Sideshow Bob: Come, come, let's run along.
(TV Studio: int. television studio - sideshow bob show)
Sideshow Bob: Hello, children. Whom do you love?
Lisa Simpson: Sideshow Bob!
Lisa Simpson: Come on, Bart. Go with the flow.
Sideshow Bob: How much do you love me?
Lisa Simpson: With all our hearts!
Bart Simpson: About a zillionth as much as I love Krusty.
Sideshow Bob: Today's show promises to be a marvelous celebration of the human spirit. But first, I regret to say I see a youngster who looks troubled.
Sideshow Bob: What's your name, young man?
Bart Simpson: Bart Simpson, sir.
Sideshow Bob: Mmm... Well, perhaps we can shed some light on your problem in a new segment exploring pre-adolescent turmoil. I call it "Choices."
Bart Simpson: I don't think so, sir.
Sideshow Bob: Bart, I'm reaching out to you.
Sideshow Bob: So what's on your mind, Bart? I bet the other children don't accept you.
Bart Simpson: True, Sideshow Bob, but that doesn't bother me. You see, my sisters and I have been doing a little investigating, and it looks to us like Krusty was framed.
Sideshow Bob: (NERVOUS) Framed?
Bart Simpson: Well, the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the Kwik-E-Mart. But Krusty couldn't go near the thing. Not with his pacemaker.
Sideshow Bob: Well, you know Bart, as much as I love Krusty, he was never one to take doctors' orders too seriously.
Bart Simpson: Well, maybe. But, get this, Krusty was illiterate and the guy who robbed the store was reading the Springfield Review of Books.
Sideshow Bob: Ah, well, Bart...
Sideshow Bob: The fact is, you don't have to be able to read to enjoy the Springfield
Sideshow Bob: Review of Books. Just look at these amusing caricatures of Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, I guess those are kinda funny.
Sideshow Bob: Bart, (TO AUDIENCE) children, this whole sordid affair has been a shock to all of us, but we must get on with our lives. Let's try to remember Krusty not as a hardened criminal, but as that lovable jester who honked his horn and puttered around in his little car.
Bart Simpson: (GOING ALONG) And shot you out of a cannon.
Sideshow Bob: (BITTERLY) And shot me out of a cannon. Yes, we will never forget that will we? (THEN) Bart, open your heart. I admit I have some mighty big shoes to fill, but if you give me a chance, I promise you won't be disap...
Sideshow Bob: (ECHOING) Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill.
Sideshow Bob: You know, in ancient Greece, there was a school of thought called stoicist...
Bart Simpson: (OUTRAGED) Wait a minute! You did it!
Sideshow Bob: Excuse me?
Bart Simpson: Attention, fellow children. Krusty didn't rob that store. Sideshow Bob framed him and I got proof.
Sideshow Bob: Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy...
Bart Simpson: See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes but he's got little feet, like all good-hearted people.
Bart Simpson: Sideshow Bob really fills his shoe with big ugly feet.
Lou: The kid's right.
Eddie: How do you figure we missed that?
Chief Wiggum: Get off your duffs, boys. Get down to that studio!
(TELEVISION STATION: ext. television station)
Sideshow Bob: Yes, I admit it. I hated him. His hackneyed shenanigans robbed me of my dignity for years. I played the buffoon while he squandered a fortune on his vulgar appetites. That's why I framed Krusty. I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for these meddling kids.
Bart Simpson: Take him away, boys.
Sideshow Bob: Treat kids as equals. They're people too. They're smarter than you think. They were smart enough to catch me.
(Jailhouse: ext. jailhouse - day)
Chief Wiggum: Well, we made a terrible, terrible mistake. Uh... won't happen again.
Krusty the Clown: It better not, you dimwit.
Homer Simpson: Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court. I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (THRU RADIO) Okay... let's see... next we have...
Krusty the Clown: Well, the important thing is that I regained the trust of the children, but there was one boy who trusted me all along. Bart?
Bart Simpson: Yes, sir.
Krusty the Clown: Thank you.

(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT)
Homer Simpson: Hey, turn it up. I love hearing those whack-os.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) Tell me about your husband, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Well. (INTO PHONE) When we were dating he was sweeter, and more romantic, and forty pounds thinner, and he had hair, and he ate with utensils.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) What was that last thing you said?
Worker One: Hey, isn't that your wife, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Don't be ridiculous. My wife worships the ground I walk on.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) Marge, I-it's what I call harsh reality time.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE; WORRIED) Ohhh.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) Your husband sees you as nothing.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh. Okay, well thank you.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) No, no, don't hang up! The pig has made you into his mother. You are not the hot love object you deserve to be.
Marge Simpson: Really?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: I'm as sure of it as I'm sure my voice is annoying. Marge, tonight, the second he comes through that front door, you've got to tell him you're fed up. And if he doesn't start loving, you'll be leaving.
Marge Simpson: Leave Homer?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Please. Don't use his real name.
Marge Simpson: Leave Pedro?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (FROM RADIO) Can you be that honest, Marge?

Dr. Marvin Monroe: (FROM RADIO) You'll tell him right when he comes home from work?

Homer Simpson: Let's just say, I don't feel like goin' home tonight. Jar, please.
Moe Szyslak: Hey, you can level with me. You got a domestic situation?
Homer Simpson: (CONTEMPLATES HIS EGG, THEN JAMS IT IN MOUTH) You might say that. My wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks I'm a pig.
Moe Szyslak: Homer?
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) What?
Moe Szyslak: Marge is right. You are a pig. You can ask anyone in this bar.
Homer Simpson: What? (YELLS) Hey, Barney, am I a pig?
Barney Gumble: (DRUNKENLY) You're no more of a pig than I am. (BURP)
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh, no.
Moe Szyslak: See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards.
Homer Simpson: Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that.
Moe Szyslak: I'm not done. (LEANS IN) After dinner, the two of you are going to check into the fanciest motel in town, and not check out until the next morning. If you get my drift.

Homer Simpson: Why?
Maitre D': Well, when you choose one that's floating upside down, it somewhat defeats the purpose of selecting a live lobster.

Bart Simpson: This way to the scene of the crime, men. I've got her tied up in the den.
Homer Simpson: Just a minute, young man. I don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but I just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off so that --
Tv Reporter: Excuse me, sir, are you saying to the world that you just aided and abetted the escape of the notorious Babysitter Bandit?
Homer Simpson: The what?

Homer Simpson: (PAUSE) Uh... uh... no. Are you sure this microphone works? (TAPS THE MIKE) Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her. (TAPS AGAIN) This is on, right? Because, actually, it was quite a struggle.

Homer Simpson: (ON TV) Have you ever seen a Kung Fu movie? (GESTURES) It was just like that. But now I know her moves. (TO CAMERA) So, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on Homer Simpson again.
Homer Simpson: (DEFEATED) Lord help me, I'm just not that bright.

Bart Simpson: (LOOKING AT BOOK) It's about these pirates. Pirates with patches over their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... and green birds on their shoulders...
Bart Simpson: Did I mention this book was written by a guy named Robert Louis Stevenson? And published by the good people at McGraw Hill.
Bart Simpson: So in conclusion, on the Simpsons' scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, one being the lowest, and five being average, I give this book... a nine.
Bart Simpson: (CLEARING THROAT) Any questions?
Bart Simpson: No? Then I'll just sit down.

Bart Simpson: (COYLY) Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Homer Simpson: Hey, Dr. J.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: I think what we have on our hands here is a classic case of what laymen refer to as fear of failure. As a result, Bart is an underachiever. And yet he seems to be... how should I put this...? Proud of it?
Homer Simpson: (NODDING) Hmmm...
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: One of his problems may be his short attention span, which can lead to...

Bart Simpson: (WILD EYED) Okay... okay! Why are we dancing around the obvious? I know it. You know it. I am dumb. Okay? Dumb as a post. Do you think I'm happy about it?
Marge Simpson: There, there, Bart. You're just a late bloomer.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Oh... I wish it were that simple. As shameful and as emotionally crippling as it may be, I'm afraid my recommendation is for Bart Simpson (BEAT) to repeat the fourth grade.
Bart Simpson: What! You can't hold me back. I'll do better, I promise.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe it would help him to be left back. It won't be so bad, Bart.
Bart Simpson: No, I mean it. You can't hold me back. I swear I'm gonna do better. Look at my eyes. See the sincerity, see the conviction, see the fear. As God is my witness, I can pass the fourth grade.
Homer Simpson: And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids.
(School Bus: INT. SCHOOL BUS - MORNING)
Otto Mann: Get off the bus or forever hold your peace, little dudes.

Otto Mann: So what's in your head, little man?
Bart Simpson: (WRINGING HANDS) Well, I've been failing a lot of tests recently.
Otto Mann: (VERY DIM) Yuh huh.
Bart Simpson: And now they're talking about holding me back in the fourth grade if I don't shape up.
Otto Mann: (NODDING) That's it? Hey, relax man. It could end up being the best thing that ever happened to you. I got held back in the fourth grade myself -- twice. And look at me, man. (WITH PRIDE) Now I drive the school bus.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: I'm afraid my recommendation is for Bart Simpson to repeat the fourth grade. (ECHOEY) Repeat the fourth grade. Repeat the fourth grade. Repeat the fourth grade.

Martin Prince: Well, back to the forecastle of the Pequod.
Bart Simpson: Hm, hey, Martin.
Homer Simpson: I have hair! Look! Look!
Martin Prince: (BACKING AWAY) You have your ball back. I have nothing else of value.
Bart Simpson: I need you to help me get a passing grade.
Martin Prince: Well, you do need someone's help to get a passing grade but I don't know why that someone should be me.
Bart Simpson: Because I can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you so much.
Martin Prince: (TAKEN ABACK) They... laugh at me? I'd always considered myself rather popular.
Bart Simpson: You're not. Watch!
Martin Prince: Then my-my speed with numbers... my years of service as a hall monitor... my prize winning diaramas... these things mean nothing to them?
Bart Simpson: Perhaps another demonstration.

Executive #3: I think you mean him, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: You then! How would you improve the worker situation?
Homer Simpson: Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks.
C. Montgomery Burns: Fish sticks? What in blazes are you talking about?
Homer Simpson: Well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them.
C. Montgomery Burns: I know what fish sticks are! Get to the point!
Homer Simpson: Well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and I always run out.
Waylon Smithers: Will you stop wasting our time, Simpson?
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up, Smithers. Can't you see what he's saying? A happy worker is a busy worker. Three cents worth of tartar sauce could save us thousands of man-hours in labor. I like the cut of your jib, Simpson. (PAUSES, TENTING HIS FINGERS) Let the fools have their tar-tar sauce!
Homer Simpson: Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmmm. Brilliant. Who could have ever imagined that Simpson's sweeping reforms would pay off so quickly?
Waylon Smithers: You know, sir, accidents decreased by exactly the number that Simpson himself is known or suspected to have caused last month. And our output level was just as high during Simpson's last vacation.
C. Montgomery Burns: My dear tired old Smithers, do I detect a note of jealousy?
C. Montgomery Burns: It is time. Give Simpson the key.
Karl: Mr. Simpson, don't sit on that filthy thing one second longer! They've given you the key!
Homer Simpson: (GASP) The key!
Karl: Stunning. Absolutely stunning.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, hey ho, men. You know I was watching the DuMont last night and I happened to catch a fascinating documentary on Rommel, the Desert Fox. Now there's a man who could get things done.
C. Montgomery Burns: Towel please, Simpson.
Waylon Smithers: Allow me, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: I said, Simpson!
Waylon Smithers: But...
Homer Simpson: Sure thing, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well done, Simpson. Now, walk behind me down the hallway.
Homer Simpson: Can do, sir.
Waylon Smithers: (READING FORM) A thousand dollars, Dimoxinil, "Keep brain from freezing." Now I've got you, Simpson.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BACKYARD - AFTERNOON)
Marge Simpson: Homer, between your hair care products and new wardrobe, we're not saving anything for a rainy day?
Homer Simpson: Rainy day. There's never gonna be a be a rainy day, Marge. There's not a cloud in the Simpson sky. And what does my little girl want?
Lisa Simpson: An absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
Homer Simpson: Yea... eh... how about a pony?
Lisa Simpson: Okay.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - DAY)
C. Montgomery Burns: I want you to weave that patented Simpson magic with my executives. A short speech, work work work, you know.
Homer Simpson: Uh, well okay, what the hey?
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. Set you to your task, Simpson.
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns, it is my sad duty to report that one of your executives has bilked the company insurance plan out of a thousand dollars.
C. Montgomery Burns: What! Blast his hide to Hades! (BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED) And I was going to buy that ivory back scratcher! How did he do it?
Waylon Smithers: He charged the company for dimoxinil. It's a baldness cure.
C. Montgomery Burns: Thank you very much, Professor Science! I know what dimoxinil is. Now go and make an example of this hooligan.
Waylon Smithers: With pleasure, sir.
Homer Simpson: Karl, you gotta help me. Mr. Burns wants me to make some speech to his executives and -- what do you want?
Waylon Smithers: Oh, just thought I'd drop by to tell you that... you're fired.
Homer Simpson: What?
Waylon Smithers: Our company does not look kindly upon one thousand dollars worth of insurance fraud. Clean out your desk by noon, Simpson.
Karl: Wait! (PAUSE) Mr. Smithers, Homer Simpson is innocent. I did this.
Homer Simpson: You did?
Waylon Smithers: What are you talking about?
Karl: Mr. Simpson was unaware of any impropriety. I take full responsibility.
Waylon Smithers: (DISAPPOINTED) Really. Oh, well then, you're fired... whoever you are.
Karl: (WRITING CHECK) Here's your thousand dollars.
Waylon Smithers: (TO KARL) Hey, what do you care if this guy's bald?
Karl: My reasons (PAUSE) are my own.
Homer Simpson: Karl, you saved me. Why?
Karl: Have I done something extraordinary here today? No. I did what I was born to do, what any good soldier would have done when a live grenade threatened his commander. I threw myself upon it and bore its terrible brunt.
Homer Simpson: Well, thanks, Karl. I don't know what to say.
Karl: Just walk me to my car.
Homer Simpson: Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you.
Karl: Bye, Mr. Simpson.
Karl: Oh, Mr. Simpson, did you bring an umbrella today?

Homer Simpson: Bart, what are you doing?
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Why you little...
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Ahhhh!
Homer Simpson: Boy must die.
Bart Simpson: (CHOKED UP) I love you, Dad.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. You ruined your father. You've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary.
Marge Simpson: Homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --
Homer Simpson: I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don't you, Marge? You do... you do. You've been squirreling it away, haven't you? Saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? Right? Right?
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Lisa Simpson: (TO BART) Dad is taking this in a less than heroic fashion.
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING)
Marge Simpson: Oh Homie, I'm so sorry.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - HOMER'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING)
Waylon Smithers: You've got that big speech in five minutes, Simpson. Huh, you're not gonna hang yourself, are you? (CHUCKLE)
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Karl: Dear Mr. Simpson: I have taken the liberty of preparing your speech on the enclosed numbered three-by five cards. All the big words are spelled (SLOWLY) phon-et-ic-al-ly. God bless you. You are one of Springfield's very special creatures. Your obedient servant, Karl. Good luck, sir.
Homer Simpson: Karl! So that wasn't just a sweet voice I heard inside my head. What are you doing here?
Karl: I just came to say goodbye to the gals in the typing pool.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, well, thanks for the speech, Karl, but I can't give it. (DISTRAUGHT) Look at me!
Karl: I guess I haven't taught you anything.
Homer Simpson: What do you mean?
Karl: Don't you see? The tartar sauce, the bathroom key -- drying your boss's hands. You did it all! It was never the hair. You did it, because you believed you could, and you still can.
Homer Simpson: No, I can't. I'm just a big fool.
Karl: Oh no, you're not.
Homer Simpson: How do you know?
Karl: Because my mother taught me never to kiss a fool.
Homer Simpson: Karl.
Karl: Now go get 'em, tiger.
Homer Simpson: (GROWL)
C. Montgomery Burns: And now, with some fresh insights, one of the rising young stars of our nuclear family, Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: What in blazes? Who is that old geezer? And what has he done with Homer Simpson?
Waylon Smithers: (CHUCKLING) He is Homer Simpson, sir.
Homer Simpson: A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.
C. Montgomery Burns: He's crazy!
Homer Simpson: Yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. Bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- I can save this company millions of dollars a year. How? Through Jiko Kanri, the Japanese art of self-management. You see, in the West... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of...
Homer Simpson: (STRUGGLING) Five thousand two... I mean... (GIVING UP) Lots of money.
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns' office. Right now.
Waylon Smithers: Dead man comin' through.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, well, well! Our dashing young junior executive! You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to.
Homer Simpson: Uh, why?
C. Montgomery Burns: (BEAT) Simpson, how old do you think I am?
Homer Simpson: I don't know... a hundred and two?
C. Montgomery Burns: I am only eighty-one. You may find this hard to believe... but in my salad days, my crowning glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ooh, I was big man on campus until my senior year, when I became as bald as a plucked chicken. You see, Simpson, I too know the sting of male-pattern baldness. That's why I'm giving you your old job back.
Homer Simpson: What! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now get out of here before I reconsider.
Homer Simpson: Oh, better hurry up.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING)
Marge Simpson: Homer, are you still awake?
Homer Simpson: I've never been more awake in my life.
Marge Simpson: What's wrong?
Homer Simpson: Are you kidding? I'm stuck in that dead-end job again. The kids are gonna hate me cause I can't buy them all that stuff I promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause I'm ugly and bald.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer. Your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it.
Homer Simpson: And... and?! (BARELY ABLE TO ASK) What about loving me?
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer, honey. Come here.
Homer Simpson: What?!
Marge Simpson: Come here. (GRABS HIS FACE) (SINGING PASSIONATELY) "YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / (CONTINUES SINGING) CAN'T YOU SEE? / YOU'RE EVERYTHING THAT I HOPED FOR /

Homer Simpson: HOMER MARGE
Homer Simpson: to me."
Marge Simpson: (CLEARING HER THROAT) Hello, everyone. (CLEARING HER THROAT) You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... things on T.V. that are completely inappropriate for younger viewers. Things like the following half hour. Nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, which I totally wash my hands of, is really scary, so if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight, instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. Thanks for your attention.
(House: ext. house - night)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Oooo! What a haul this year. I love Halloween.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. Let's see what the kids are up to.
Lisa Simpson: ... and the policeman on the other end of the phone said, "We have traced the call. It's coming from the floor below you. Get out of the house!" But it was too late. End of story.
Bart Simpson: Yawn. I heard that when I was in the third grade. It's not scary.
Lisa Simpson: Is too.
Bart Simpson: Is not.
Lisa Simpson: Is too.
Bart Simpson: Is not.
Lisa Simpson: Is too.
Bart Simpson: Is not.
Lisa Simpson: Fine. Then you tell one scarier.
Bart Simpson: Flashlight, please.
Bart Simpson: Here's a story that's really scarifying.

Moving Man: A buck! I'm glad there's a curse on this place.
Homer Simpson: Huh? (TO FAMILY - SURVEYING THE ROOM) Well... it's all ours!
Marge Simpson: I still can't believe how inexpensive it was.
Homer Simpson: Motivated seller, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Well, he certainly must have been motivated. Prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able to afford this.
Homer Simpson: So we got a good deal for once. Quit fighting it.
Marge Simpson: It just seems too good to be true.
Lisa Simpson: Ow! Mom! Bart threw a book at me.
Bart Simpson: Did not.
Lisa Simpson: Did too.
Bart Simpson: Did not.

Homer Simpson: Okay boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one.
Lisa Simpson: (QUIETLY) I can feel an evil presence in this house.
Marge Simpson: Evil!
Homer Simpson: Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your mother.
Marge Simpson: Children, get your coats. We're leaving this house right now.
Homer Simpson: Now wait a minute, Marge. It's only natural there would be some things wrong with an old house like this. It's a fixer-upper. What's the problem? we get a bunch of priests in here...
Marge Simpson: I'm not going to live in a house of evil just to save a few dollars.
Homer Simpson: (GENUINELY OUTRAGED) Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars! We're talking about a few thousand dollars!
Homer Simpson: It's got great high ceilings.

Kang: I beg your pardon.

Kang: You mean this? (HOLDS UP BOOK) It's a harmless cookbook. It's just a little dusty.
Lisa Simpson: Wait a minute!
Kang: Wait, there's still more space dust on here.
Kang: (UTTER DISBELIEF) Let me get this straight. You thought...
Kodos: (ANGRY) They thought we were going to eat them.
Kang: (APPALLED) Good God! Is this some kind of joke?
Kodos: No, they're serious...
Lisa Simpson: Well, why were you trying to make us eat all the time?
Kang: Make you eat? We merely provided a sumptuous banquet and, frankly, you people made pigs of yourselves.
Serak The Preparer: I slaved in the kitchen for days for you people and...
Kang: (SARCASTIC) Well, if you wanted to make Serak the Preparer cry, mission accomplished.

(CHAMBER: int. chamber - night)
Lisa Simpson: Once upon a midnight dreary,
Lisa Simpson: while I pondered, weak and weary,
V.O.: Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Marge Simpson: Like what?
V.O.: As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
Homer Simpson: (DISMISSING) 'Tis some visitor,
V.O.: I muttered,
Homer Simpson: -- tapping at my chamber door -- Only this and nothing more.
Bart Simpson: Are we scared yet?
Lisa Simpson: Bart, he's establishing mood.
V.O.: Ah, distinctly I remember. It was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; -- vainly I had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow:
V.O.: -- sorrow for the lost Lenore --
Homer Simpson: Oh, Lenore.
V.O.: For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -- Nameless here for evermore.
Homer Simpson: Aag!
V.O.: And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating;
Homer Simpson: (TERRIFIED, CHANTING RAPIDLY) 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- This it is and nothing more.
V.O.: Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer;
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY AND OBSEQUIOUSLY) Sir --
V.O.: -- said I --
Homer Simpson: -- or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you.
V.O.: Here I opened wide the door; --
Bart Simpson: This better be good.
V.O.: Darkness there and nothing more.
Bart Simpson: You know what would have been scarier than nothing?
Lisa Simpson: What?
Bart Simpson: Anything!
V.O.: Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Surely --
V.O.: -- said I --
Homer Simpson: -- surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --
Chief Inspector: Mr. Burns in twenty years I have never seen such a shoddy, deplorable --
(Simpson Dining Room: int. simpsons' dining room - next evening)
V.O.: Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he, But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -- Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -- Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES, THEN FRIENDLY) Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --
V.O.: I said --
Homer Simpson: -- art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- Tell me... tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Bart Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Eat my shorts!
Lisa Simpson: Bart! Stop it. He says "nevermore". That's all he'll ever say.
Bart Simpson: Okay, okay.
V.O.: Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by some unseen censer,
Homer Simpson: Ouch! Censer..
V.O.: Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
Homer Simpson: (PLEADING) Wretch --
V.O.: I cried --
Homer Simpson: -- thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. (GETTING TEARY) Respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Raven: Nevermore.
Homer Simpson: (ANOTHER ANNOYED GRUNT, THEN) Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!
V.O.: I shrieked of starting,
Homer Simpson: Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Oh, leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Raven: Nevermore.
Homer Simpson: Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Raven: Nevermore.
Homer Simpson: Why you little --!
Raven: Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Come back here now, Raven
Bart Simpson: Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore.
(GARAGE: INT. GARAGE - DAY)
V.O.: And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting, On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, Shall be lifted -- nevermore!
(Bart's Treehouse: INT. TREE HOUSE)
Bart Simpson: Lisa, that wasn't scary. Not even for a poem.
Lisa Simpson: Well, it was written in 1845. Maybe people were easier to scare back then.
Bart Simpson: Well yeah, like when you look at "Friday The 13th, Part I," it's pretty tame by today's standards.
Marge Simpson: Children, bedtime.
Bart Simpson: I guess I'll have no trouble gettin' to sleep tonight.

Homer Simpson: Oh... oh, I hate Halloween.
(SUNNY SKY: ext. sunny sky - day)
Dave Shutton: (INTERESTED NOISE) So kids, caught anything?
Lisa Simpson: Not yet, sir.
Dave Shutton: Uh-huh. Ah, What are you using for bait?
Lisa Simpson: My brother's using worms but I who feel that tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing.
Dave Shutton: I see. And uh, what's your name, son?
Bart Simpson: I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Dave Shutton: (CHUCKLE) I'm Dave Shutton. I'm an investigative reporter who's on the road a lot, and uh, I must say that in my day we didn't talk that way to our elders.
Bart Simpson: Well, this is my day and we do, sir.
Bart Simpson: All right! We eat tonight!
Dave Shutton: Wait a minute. (STARTS COUNTING) One, two, three.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - morning)
Marge Simpson: Well leave it to good old Mary Bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.
Homer Simpson: (SNORTS) Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time.
Homer Simpson: Like getting Washington's birthday and Lincoln's birthday back as separate paid holidays. (DERISIVELY) President's Day! Pfft. What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out --
Marge Simpson: You're late for work, Homer.
Homer Simpson: So... Someone will punch in for me.
Lisa Simpson: Try not to spill anything, Dad.
Bart Simpson: Keep those mutants comin', Homer.
Homer Simpson: I'll mutant you.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - day)
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh, man. Plain cake donuts? Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. (MUMBLING TO HIMSELF) Why can't I ever get here on time?
C. Montgomery Burns: (OVER P.A.- FRIENDLY) Hi, ho, faceless employees. In a few moments the government inspection team will be touring your plant so look busy and keep your mouths shut. That is all.
(SECURITY CLEARANCE BOOTH AT POWER PLANT: ext. security clearance booth at power plant)
Waylon Smithers: Very stirring, sir.
Waylon Smithers: Uh oh. Here they come.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hold me, Smithers.
Chief Inspector: (TO TEAM) Okay men, Geiger counters on.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES WEAKLY) I suppose that's normal background radiation? The kind you would find in any well-maintained nuclear facility? Or, for that matter, playgrounds and hospitals.
Chief Inspector: Sorry.
(COOLING TOWER: EXT. COOLING TOWER - DAY)
Chief Inspector: (WHISTLES) Gum used to seal crack in cooling tower.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm as shocked as you are.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - work station)
Chief Inspector: Plutonium rod used as paperweight.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Now, that shouldn't be.
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISMISSING) Yeah. Well that's always been like that.
Homer Simpson: (WAKENS WITH A SHRIEK) Uh, uh, just resting my eyes.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, well done. A rested employee is a vigilant employee.
Chief Inspector: Monitoring station unmanned.
(Other Part of Nuclear Plant: int. another part of power plant)
C. Montgomery Burns: Look here, Inspector. Could I speak to you privately I-in my office?
(Burns's Office: INT. BURNS' OFFICE)
(Burns's Living Room: int. burns' living room - that night)
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, look! Some careless person has left thousands and thousands of dollars just lying here on my coffee table. Uh, Smithers, why don't we leave the room and hopefully, when we return the pile of money will be gone.
C. Montgomery Burns: (THROUGH HIS TEETH) Look Smithers, the money and a very stupid man are still here.
Chief Inspector: Burns, if I didn't know better I'd think you were trying to bribe me.
C. Montgomery Burns: Is there some confusion about this?
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRILY) Take it! Take it, take it, you poor schmoe.
Chief Inspector: Mr. Burns, I am going to overlook this felony. However, I will not overlook the three hundred and forty-two violations I have observed at your plant today. Either bring this place up to code or we'll shut it down. Good-day.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, well... a little dab of paint here, a little spackle there... how much could it possibly cost to fix this place up?
Waylon Smithers: Hmmm, approximately fifty-six million dollars, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRILY) Fifty-six million!
Waylon Smithers: (FRIGHTENED) Don't hit me, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (DEFEATED) Oh, that I had the strength to take it out on you, Smithers. Now please go. I would be alone.
C. Montgomery Burns: (MELANCHOLY SINGING) ONCE I BUILT A RAILROAD / MADE IT RUN / MADE IT RACE AGAINST TIME/ ONCE I BUILT A RAILROAD / NOW IT'S DONE / BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE A DIME./ HALF A MILLION BOOTS WENT SLOGGING THROUGH HELL / I WAS THE KID WITH THE DRUM.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - outside secondary monitoring station)
C. Montgomery Burns: Empty! Bah!!
Homer Simpson: Ah! (WAKING) Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. (LOOKS AT HIS WATCH) Holy moly! Nine-thirty.
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Marge. Sorry I didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... Yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me.
Homer Simpson: Echo, echo... (ECHO CONTINUES) (CHUCKLE)
C. Montgomery Burns: (SINGING) HEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER / THEY CALLED ME AL / IT WAS AL ALL THE TIME / HEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER / I'M YOUR PAL / BUDDY, CAN'T YOU SPARE A DIME.
(ROLLS ROYCE: int. rolls royce - night)
Homer Simpson: (TAPPING ON CAR WINDOW) Huh? What th... Uh, Mr. Burns?
C. Montgomery Burns: (STARTLED) Ah!
Homer Simpson: (SMALL SCREAM) Sorry, sir. It's just me, Homer Simpson. Is everything all right?
C. Montgomery Burns: Working late, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Uh... uh yes, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: You and I are a dying breed, Simpson. I'm going to share something with you. Hop in.
Homer Simpson: (BOUNCING ON SEAT) Ooooh, cushy.
C. Montgomery Burns: Homer, they're trying to shut us down.
C. Montgomery Burns: They say we're contaminating the planet.
Homer Simpson: Well, nobody's perfect.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why can't the government just get off our backs?
Homer Simpson: You know, I was just telling the wife that if I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRILY) Oh, get off your soapbox, Simpson! Do you realize how much it costs to run for office? More than any honest man can afford.
Homer Simpson: I bet you could afford it, though.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) Uh... don't get me wrong. I mean you're an honest man. I just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'Course I'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. I mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't.
Homer Simpson: Where are we going, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: To create a new and better world.
Homer Simpson: (TIMIDLY) If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?
Homer Simpson: Well, he's got my vote.
Marge Simpson: Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family.
Homer Simpson: Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Monty Burns.
Lisa Simpson: (BEAMING) Oooo, a political discussion at our table. I feel like a Kennedy.
Marge Simpson: Well, frankly, I don't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against Mary Bailey, the most beloved governor our great state has ever known.
(Burns's Office: int. BURNS' OFFICE - DAY)
Dean Danielson: Now, here's the problem as I see it: While Governor Bailey is beloved by all, ninety-eight percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse. That's why we've assembled the finest campaign team money can buy. (POINTING TO EACH AS HE GOES) This is your speech writer...
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh uh.
Dean Danielson: your joke writer...
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh uh.
Dean Danielson: your spin doctor...
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh uh.
Dean Danielson: your make-up man...
C. Montgomery Burns: Yeah.
Dean Danielson: and your personal trainer.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oooo!
Dean Danielson: Their job... to turn this Mr. Burns...
DANIELSON: ...into this.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why are my teeth showing like that?
DANIELSON: Because you're smiling.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah. Excellent. This is exactly the kind of trickery I'm paying you for. But, but how do we turn your average Joe Sixpack against Mary Bailey?
DANIELSON: With this team of investigators: your muckraker...
C. Montgomery Burns: How do you do.
DANEILSON: Your character assassin...
C. Montgomery Burns: Nice to meet you.
DANEILSON: your mudslinger...
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah...
DANIELSON: your garbologist.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello!
DANIELSON: Their job is to turn Mary Bailey from this...into this.
C. Montgomery Burns: Visual aids help so much. Thank you.
DANIELSON: But first, there's a burning issue that we need to address and neutralize immediately.
C. Montgomery Burns: I hate that fish!
(Springfield Retirement Castle: int. springfield retirement home)
TV Announcer: (FROM TV) Thank you for watching Movie for a Dreary Afternoon. Please stay tuned for a paid political announcement brought to you by the Friends of Montgomery Burns.
Grampa Simpson: Burns! Change the channel.
Jasper Beardly: You change it.
Grampa Simpson: No, you change it.
OLD BEARDED GUY: I changed it last week.
Grampa Simpson: Fine. Be a jerk. Then we'll just sit here and watch it.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Barney Gumble: (RE: TV) Oh, no. An election! That's one of those deals where they close the bars, isn't it?
Moe Szyslak: (NODS) Sorry, Barney.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Marge Simpson: I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Marge. What's the big deal? I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
(TV Studio: int. tv studio)
Waylon Smithers: Thirty seconds to air, Mr. Burns.
DANIELSON: Now, remember to smile.
C. Montgomery Burns: I am smiling.
DANIELSON: You'll have to do better than that.
C. Montgomery Burns: (GRUNTS TWICE) How's this?
DANIELSON: There you go.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm going to be sore tomorrow.
DANIELSON: Well, we've done all we can, Mr. Burns. The rest is up to you.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, don't worry --
C. Montgomery Burns: -- by the time this paid political announcement is done, every Johnny Lunchpail in this whole stupid state will be eating out of my hand.

(Studio: int. studio)
C. Montgomery Burns: (INTO CAMERA, REALIZING) Oh, hello friends. I'm Montgomery Burns, your next governor, and I'm here to talk to you about my little friend, here. Blinky.
C. Montgomery Burns: Many of you consider him to be a hideous genetic mutation. Nothing could be further from the truth. But don't take my word for it. Let's ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin what he thinks.
Charles Darwin: Hello, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh hello, Charles. Be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection.
Charles Darwin: Glad to, Mr. Burns. You see, every so often Mother Nature changes her animals giving them bigger teeth, sharper claws, longer legs or, in this case, a third eye. And if these variations turn out to be an improvement, the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the face of the earth.
C. Montgomery Burns: So... you're saying this fish might have an advantage over other fish. It may, in fact, be a kind of super fish!
Charles Darwin: I wouldn't mind having a third eye, would you?
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES) No. You see, friends... if our anti-nuclear naysayers and choose-up-siders were to come upon an elephant frolicking in the waters next to our nuclear power plant, they'd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman.
C. Montgomery Burns: The truth is this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that can't be beat. Mmmm mmmm. So, to summarize: Say what you want about me. I can take the slings and arrows. But stop slandering poor, defenseless Blinky. Good night and God bless.
Singers: ONLY A MORON/ WOULDN'T CAST HIS VOTE/FOR MONTY BURNS.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Barney Gumble: Wow! Super fish!
Moe Szyslak: I wish the government would get off his back.
(Springfield Retirement Castle: int. springfield retirement home)
Grampa Simpson: That Burns is just what this state needs... young blood.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - LIVING ROOM)
Homer Simpson: I hope Burns and I can count on your support, honey.
Marge Simpson: Homer... (PINS ON BAILEY BUTTON) I'm a Bailey Booster.
Homer Simpson: Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a Burns Booster. (PINS ON BURNS BUTTON; STICKS HIMSELF) Ow!
(Burns's Office: INT. BURNS' OFFICE)
DANIELSON: Congratulations, Mr. Burns. The latest polls show you're up six points.
C. Montgomery Burns: Giving me a total of...
DANIELSON: Six. But we're on our way!
MARY BAILEY: My worthy opponent seems to think that the voters of this state are gullible fools. I, however, prefer to rely on their intelligence and good judgment.
C. Montgomery Burns: And I say taxes are too high!
C. Montgomery Burns: Have you found any dirt on Mary Bailey?
Investigator #1: Well, we've gone through her garbage...
Investigator #2: We've talked to her maid...
Investigator #1: And so far, the only negative thing we have found is from some guy who dated her when she was sixteen.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, and?
Investigator #3: He felt her up.
C. Montgomery Burns: Bah! Not good enough!
C. Montgomery Burns: We're gonna send - a message - to those bureaucrats - down there in the State Capital!
Bart Simpson: Is your boss Governor yet?
Homer Simpson: Not yet, son. Not yet.
DANIELSON: The voters now see you as imperial and God-like.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hot dog!
DANIELSON: But there's a downside to it. The latest polls indicate you're in danger of losing touch with the common man.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SARCASTIC) Oh, dear. Heaven forefend.
DANIELSON: Which is why the night before the election, we want you to have dinner at the home of one of your workers.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh. I get your angle. Every Joe Meatball and Sally Housecoat in this God-forsaken state will see me hunkering down for chow with Eddie Punchclock. The media will have a field day!
DANIELSON: The only question is -- can we find someone common enough...
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISGUSTED) Well, I... I knew there would be sacrifices.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen)
Homer Simpson: (CRUNCH) Ah... great toast, Marge. Hmmm. Oh, by the way, the night before the election Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner.
Marge Simpson: What!
Homer Simpson: And some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them.
Bart Simpson: Cool man! A media circus.
Marge Simpson: Absolutely not!
Homer Simpson: Come on, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Huh uh. I'm going to be ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey that night.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT, THEN FIRMLY) Kids, please leave the room. I don't want you to see this.
Bart Simpson: Uh oh.
Homer Simpson: (DROPPING TO KNEES) Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
DANIELSON: We're hoping that one of the children might pop up with a question about the upcoming election. (HANDS LISA A PIECE OF PAPER) Little girl, do you think you can memorize this by dinner time tomorrow?
Lisa Simpson: (READING OFF PAPER) "Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?"
DANIELSON: Very good.
Lisa Simpson: Hmmm. Well as long as I'm asking something, can I ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable?
DANIELSON: No, dear. The card question will be fine.
Marge Simpson: Well I think the non-card question is a valid one.
Homer Simpson: Marge! (TO DANIELSON) Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, I'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES) Only an innocent child could get away with such blasphemy. God bless them all. Amen.
DANIELSON: And finally, Mr. Burns wants you to appear very affectionate to him. But we must remind you, he hates being touched.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpsons house - night - establishing)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Marge, get back in bed.
Marge Simpson: No, I'm just fine right here.
Homer Simpson: What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.
Marge Simpson: Well, I don't feel like snuggling.
Homer Simpson: What's that got to do with it?
Marge Simpson: I don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself.
Homer Simpson: But you do get to express yourself. In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve.
Marge Simpson: (DEADLY CALM) Okay, Homer. Fair enough. You got it! All right! Good! That's it. That's how I'm gonna express myself. That's right. Goodnight.
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Make-up Man: Well, what do we think?
Homer Simpson: Hey! Hello, handsome!
DANIELSON: Hey, get that stuff off his face. We're here to have dinner with the common man, not Tyrone Power.
Gregor: The latest polls are in. It's dead even -- fifty-fifty. This cornball stunt is gonna put us over the top.
Bart Simpson: Whoa! He's here!
(House: ext. house - front door)
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello, Homer. Marge, you look (PAUSE) dazzling. Oh, and look, I've brought noodle kugel.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY) Bad dog! Bad neighbor dog! Here, let me help you up, Mr. Burns. (GRUNTS)
C. Montgomery Burns: (LAUGHING) I love dogs... babies, too.
C. Montgomery Burns: Aaaah... kitty, kitty.
Homer Simpson: Are you all right, Mr. Burns?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, of course. (THROUGH HIS TEETH) A little roughhousing with the pets is good for a man's appetite.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - dining room)
DANIELSON: (TO BURNS) The latest polls are in. The statesman-like way you handled the pet incident has put you over the top. You're ahead fifty-one to forty-nine. Congratulations, Mr. Governor!
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) Bart, would you like to say grace?
Bart Simpson: Dear God, we paid for all this stuff ourselves, so thanks for nothin'.
(PRESS BOX: INt. PRESS BOX)
DANIELSON: (TO GREGOR) He's smokin'. He's smokin'.
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL, READING) "You know, Mr. Burns, my family and I (BURP) feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?"
C. Montgomery Burns: (FEIGNING SURPRISE) Goodness! I didn't realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate.
Homer Simpson: I was only reading what the card...
C. Montgomery Burns: (OVERRIDING HIM) Homer, I agree with you and, if I'm elected governor (GESTICULATES WILDLY), I will lower taxes whether those bureaucrats in the State capital like it or not.
C. Montgomery Burns: Lisa, do you have a question you would like to ask your Uncle Montgomery?
Lisa Simpson: Yes, sir. A very inane one. (SIGHS, THEN, SLOWLY DYING INSIDE) Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oooh, a tough question, but a fair one. Lisa, there's no single answer. Some voters respond to my integrity. Others are more impressed with my incorruptibility... still others by my determination to lower taxes, and the bureaucrats in the state capital can put that in their pipes and smoke it.
Lisa Simpson: Oh Mom, that felt awful.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, dear. It will all be over soon.
Lisa Simpson: But Mom, we've become the tools of evil.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt.
C. Montgomery Burns: ...some can't even get a fair shake, or even a square deal... Ummmm, smells delightful.
Bart Simpson: All right! Three eyed fish!
Marge Simpson: Can I have your plate, Mr. Burns?
DANIELSON: Ruined before it hit the ground.
Reporter #1: Get me the city desk...
Reporter #2: (INTO PHONE) Here's your headline, Phil: "Burns Can't Swallow Own Story."
Scott Christian: The latest polls indicate Burns' popularity has plummeted to earth like so much half-chewed fish.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO DANIELSON & GREGOR) You must have a few tricks left up your sleeves. (ROLLS UP SLEEVES) Smithers, boil some coffee. We're not licked yet.
DANIELSON: Yes, we are. Come on boys, the old guy's finished.
C. Montgomery Burns: (RISING FRENZY) Wait! Come back! You can't do this to me! I'm Charles Montgomery Burns!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, tip over this table for me!
Waylon Smithers: Yes sir.
Marge Simpson: (LOW) Homer... Homer... make them stop.
Homer Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT THEN, VERY POLITELY) Uh, Mr. Burns... Uh, Mr. Burns...
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up and wreck something.
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Burns, I hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SIGHS) She's right. Take me home, Smithers. We'll destroy something tasteful.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO SMITHERS) Ironic, isn't it Smithers? This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes has cost me the election, and yet if I were to have them killed, I would be the one to go to jail. That's democracy for you.
Waylon Smithers: You are noble and poetic in defeat, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO HOMER) Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled.
Bart Simpson: Uh oh. You're busted, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled! Oh no. I don't like the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, make it better. Please. Can't you make it better, huh?
Marge Simpson: Homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling, and sleeping till noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them.
Homer Simpson: Hey, you did it!
(Moe's Tavern: int. Moe's tavern - night)
Barney Gumble: So, Homer. What happened in Capitol City?
Homer Simpson: Aw, Barney.
Moe Szyslak: Come on, Homer. We're dyin' of curiosity.
Homer Simpson: Look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. It's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. And I never want that to happen to me.
Barney Gumble: Please, Homer.
Moe Szyslak: C'mom, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Well, okay. It all started on "Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night," down at Springfield stadium.
(STADIUM: ext. stadium - evening)

Homer Simpson: You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day.
Bart Simpson: What? Aren't we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers?
Homer Simpson: Sure, we get a nice mix here.
Lisa Simpson: I can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard. There's just the green grass of the outfield, the crushed brick of the infield, and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here.
Marge Simpson: I hope you'll space out the tubs this year, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) What are you getting at?
Marge Simpson: Well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire.
Homer Simpson: Marge, (HOLDING UP THE TICKET) this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, the Gammills. Good to see you.

Homer Simpson: Uh... Simp-sons, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONSULTING CARD) Huh? Hmmm, oh, oh yes... Homer and Marge Simpson. Oh, and these must be Bart, Lisa and uh, "Expecting".

FLASH: Hey there, little lady. What can Flash do for ya?
Marge Simpson: Here you go, Bart.

P.A. Announcer: (HEAVILY ECHOED) Ladies and gentlemen, throwing out tonight's first ball, the man whose name is synonymous with our nation's safest and cleanest energy source, Mr. Montgomery Burns!
Waylon Smithers: Ah, they love you, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Heh, heh. As well they might. You know, Smithers, when I was a young buck, my patented fadeaway pitch was compared by many to the "trouble ball" of the late great Satchel Paige. Spit on this for me, Smithers.
Waylon Smithers: One hocker coming up, sir.
Bart Simpson: What a lame-o!
Waylon Smithers: I could actually hear the air being torn, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, shut up.

C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, sitting with the employees. I guess this proves I'm their friend. (THEN) You did get me something on an aisle, Smithers? I don't want to be surrounded by them.
Homer Simpson: Let's go now... Sa-winggg, batter!
Bart Simpson: We want a pitcher / Not a belly itcher!
Lisa Simpson: We want a catcher / Not a belly scratcher!
Waylon Smithers: Here we are, sir.
Homer Simpson: (SOTTO) Oh, no. Marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! (GRUMBLING) Of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks...
Marge Simpson: All this means is you can't wave your fanny in public.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Rub it in.
Vendor: Beeer heah! Duff Beeer
Vendor: VENDOR (O.S.) HOMER
Vendor: Get your Duff Beer (WISTFULLY SOTTO)
Vendor: heah! Beer, right Beer. Didja hear
Vendor: here! Duff Beer! that, Marge?
Homer Simpson: Delicious frosty beer. Fat lot of good that does me, sitting next to old man Burns.
Marge Simpson: (WARNING) Now, Homer.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO HOMER) I suppose you want a beer?
Homer Simpson: Me, sir? Oh, no. Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer.
C. Montgomery Burns: Actually, I was wondering if you'd join me. My treat.
Homer Simpson: Ohhh. Well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm all turned around on the subject. Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?
C. Montgomery Burns: No. (TO VENDOR) Vendor, two, please.
VENDER: Two-fifty.
(BALL PARK: ext. ball park - later)
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHANTING) THE HITTER'S OFF HIS ROCKER / KISSING BETTY CROCKER!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Good one, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh well, I used to rile the late, great Connie Mack with that one at old Shibe Park.
Homer Simpson: (CHANTING) LITTLE BABY BATTER / CAN'T CONTROL HIS BLADDER! (LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: Will you shut up, I'm trying to think of a name.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmmm. Crude, but I like it. (THEN, HOLDING UP 72 OZ. TUB) What do you say we freshen up our little drinkie poos?
Homer Simpson: Don't mind if I do.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, Simpsie, you up for another wave?
Homer Simpson: All right, Burnsie.
Dan Hoard: Bases loaded. 'Topes have one out, down by three. Here's the pitch. Swung on and missed! Strike three. Of course.
C. Montgomery Burns: Damnation! These banjos couldn't carry Pie Traynor's glove.
Dan Hoard: Big Bill McCloskey coming up. As soon as he pops out, we'll go right to the post-game show.
Homer Simpson: C'mon! All we need is a grand slam.
C. Montgomery Burns: My one game of the year... ruined by pathetic incompetence.
Homer Simpson: What's wrong with you people? Let's show some spirit! Come on, get up!
Homer Simpson: (TO THE CROWD) Your team needs you! C'mon!!!
Homer Simpson: As I got up in front of them, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle.
Dan Hoard: ... There's some nut down in right field, dancin' up a storm! He's really got the crowd goin'. Let's see if he can shake up mediocre slugger "Big Bill" McCloskey.
Dan Hoard: Swung on and belted to deep left field! It's going... going...
Dan Hoard: It's gone! It's outta here! Oh, my God, the Isotopes win a game! The Isotopes win a game! The Isotopes win a game!
Waylon Smithers: Well, that was certainly exciting.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes. Unfortunately, Homer Simpson's shameless display of exhibitionism tainted the entire evening. I want him banned for life from all company outings.
Waylon Smithers: (LAUGHS)
(Parking Lot: ext. parking lot - moments later)
Homer Simpson: I thank you. You're too kind. Glad you enjoyed it, but I can't take all the credit. The batter did his part, too.
MR. O'HARA: Excuse me... You, sir -- the dancing fella. I'm Antoine "Tex" O'Hara. I own the Isotopes. Would you be interested in becoming our official mascot?
Homer Simpson: M-- me? A mascot for a bush league team?
Homer Simpson: I should have slept on it. Or at least stared blankly for a while. Perhaps if I'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared.
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm ready to punch in.
Bart Simpson: Oh, oh. Hey, cool, man.
Lisa Simpson: Our lives have taken an odd turn.
Marge Simpson: Did the team ask you to dress like that, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Nope, this was my own bright idea. (THEN) C'mon, we gotta hurry. Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos.
Homer Simpson: For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me.
Dan Hoard: 'Topes win! 'Topes win! Two in a row! Two in a row!
Marge Simpson: A Simpson on a T-shirt. I never thought I'd see the day.
Homer Simpson: Oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. Woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie.
Player #2: Hey, knock that off or I'll stick this bat where the sun don't shine.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah? And where might that be? (REALIZING) Oh.
Homer Simpson: Helen, I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight. How 'bout giving me "Baby Elephant Walk" with a little reggae kinda beat?
Rasta #1: Go, "Dancin' Homer"! Git up man, git up!
Rasta #2: Lively up yourself, Dancin' Homer.
(BALLPARK: ext. ballpark - evening)
Dan Hoard: Bases loaded, two outs. The good guys trail by a run.
Dan Hoard: Here's the pitch... swung on and missed -- strike three. (DEPRESSED) 'Topes lose... 'Topes lose...'Topes lose...
(OWNER'S OFFICE: int. owner's office - minutes later)
Homer Simpson: You wanted to see me, "Tex"?
MR. O'HARA: Homer, now we both knew when you began doing this you weren't gonna be here forever...
Homer Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick.
MR. O'HARA: Homer, I'm not firing you. I just got the word -- You've been called up to Capital City.
Homer Simpson: Me? In the majors?
MR. O'HARA: That's right.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Capital City has a mascot. The greatest mascot there is: The Capital City "Goofball".
MR. O'HARA: Yeah, but he's getting on in years and he needs someone to fill in for a couple of innings a night. Could be a big opportunity for you.
Homer Simpson: I'll say!
MR. O'HARA: Why don't you talk it over with your family?
Homer Simpson: (WHINING) Because they might say no.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's bar - continuous)
Homer Simpson: This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced. I should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.
Homer Simpson: I shouldn't have called her that. Bite my tongue. Bite my tongue. (BITES TONGUE) Oooh.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson HOUSE - LIVING ROOM)
Lisa Simpson: I can't leave Springfield. I was born here and I thought I would die here.
Homer Simpson: It won't be so bad. You'll die someplace else.
Bart Simpson: Well, what am I supposed to do about friends?
Homer Simpson: Phfft. You'll make new and better friends.
Lisa Simpson: But, Dad. We're simple people with simple values. Capital City is too big and too complex. Everyone in Springfield knows us and has forgiven us.
Marge Simpson: Homer, I'd be lying if I didn't say that this scares me a little. But we all have a calling, a reason The Almighty put us on this Earth. And yours might be to dance on dugouts.
Homer Simpson: You mean -- ?
Marge Simpson: Let's do it, Homer!
Bart Simpson: Yeah, let's blow this pop stand and never look back.
Lisa Simpson: Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
Homer Simpson: It's not that simple. I've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. nuclear plant - day)
Supervisor: Sure. What would you like -- four years? Five years?
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day)
NED: So, Simpson. You're really moving to Capital City?
Homer Simpson: That's right, Ned.
NED: (INDICATING STUFF ON LAWN) Uh huh. And all this stuff is for sale, huh? You know, I-I-I... don't know how to say this, but, well...
Homer Simpson: Oh, knock it off, Flanders! Don't start blubbering on me. I'm gonna miss you too... (UNDER IS BREATH) not.
(Bart's Treehouse: int. treehouse - day)
Milhouse Van Houten: I don't know, Bart. I mean, I'm gonna miss you and all, but...
Bart Simpson: Come on, Milhouse. This way we'll be friends forever.
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, okay.
Milhouse Van Houten: Ewww!
Bart Simpson: I'm gonna miss you, spit brother.
Milhouse Van Houten: I'm gonna miss you, spit brother.
(Springfield Elementary School Yard: ext. schoolyard - another section)
Lisa Simpson: I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, my leaving would actually have meant something.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day)
Marge Simpson: Well, we have one quick stop and then it's on to Capital City.
Patty Bouvier: I can't believe it. Our baby sister in the big city.
Selma Bouvier: I'll call you every day.
Patty Bouvier: I'll call you, too.
Patty Bouvier: Look, he can use a horn.
Selma Bouvier: (TO HOMER) Oh, shut up.
(BALLPARK: ext. ballpark - night)
Homer Simpson: ... Some may say that I have been given a bad break in life -- little education, bald as a cue ball, ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today, as I leave for Capital City, I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the Earth!
Homer Simpson: With the fickle fans already forgetting me, I was ready to take the biggest step of my life.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(Highway: ext. highway - day)
(Capital City: ext. capital city - night)
Homer Simpson: Well kids, there it is, Capital City.
Marge Simpson: Look! The Crosstown Bridge!
Bart Simpson: Wow!
Homer Simpson: Wow!
Tony Bennett: "THERE'S A SWINGIN' TOWN I KNOW /
Tony Bennett: CALLED CAPITAL CITY..."
Lisa Simpson: The Pennyloafer!
Tony Bennett: "PEOPLE STOP AND SCREAM HELLO /
Tony Bennett: IN CAPITAL CITY..."
Homer Simpson: Kids, look! Street crime!
Tony Bennett: "IT'S THE KIND OF PLACE THAT MAKES
Tony Bennett: A BUM / FEEL LIKE A KING..."
Homer Simpson: Wow! That's service!
Tony Bennett: "AND IT MAKES A KING FEEL LIKE/
Tony Bennett: SOME NUTTY KOO-KOO SUPER-KING..."
Marge Simpson: Look, it's Tony Bennett!
Tony Bennett: Hey, good to see you.
Tony Bennett: "IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO FROWN /
Marge Simpson: Oh, well, we're all out, Homer.
Tony Bennett: IN CAPITAL CITY. "YOU'LL CAPER LIKE A STUPID CLOWN / WHEN YOU CHANCE TO SEE..."
Marge Simpson: Fourth Street and D!
Tony Bennett: "...FOURTH STREET AND D!/ YEAH!/ ONCE YOU GET A WHIFF OF IT...YOU'LL NEVER WANT TO ROAM."
Homer Simpson: (REVERENTIAL) The Duff Brewery!
Tony Bennett: FROM CAPITAL CITY, MY HOME SWEET HOME / CAPITAL CITY... THAT HAPPYTOWN CITY / IT'S CAPITAL CITY, MY HOME, SWEET, SWINGIN' HOME"
Lisa Simpson: Capital City -- yeah!
(Hotel Room: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: Awww. Come to bed, Homie.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, honey. I'm just a little nervous.
Homer Simpson: We would talk about it always. For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did.
(Capital City Cap Dome: ext. capital city cap dome - dusk)
Homer Simpson: Okay, here are your tickets. They're supposed to be good. You're sitting with the player's wives. And don't forget to cheer for me.
Marge Simpson: See you after the game, when you're a big star.
Homer Simpson: Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.
(CAP CITY DOME: INT. CAP CITY DOME)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Wow.
Homer Simpson: Omigod! I don't believe it. It's really you, the Capital City "Goofball."
Capital City Goofball: Hello, Dancin' Homer. Glad to have you aboard. If there's anything I can do for you (POINTS TO HIS BIG NOSE) just squeeze the wheeze.
(Locker Room: int. locker room - evening)
Capital City Goofball: The fifth inning will be yours. Everyone is settled in, they've had a coupla beers; the game is official. It's a pretty important inning.
Homer Simpson: Wow, the fifth.
Capital City Goofball: It's also the inning I wish I had a zipper on the front of this thing, if you know what I mean.
Homer Simpson: Right, Mr. Goofball.
Capital City Goofball: Hey, call me plain ol' "Goof". So what exactly do you have planned for us?
Homer Simpson: Well, I get up, I dance, I spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of Baby Elephant Walk.
Capital City Goofball: Aah, Mancini. The mascot's best friend. Well, see you on that field. I'll set 'em up, you knock 'em down.
(CAP DOME: int. cap dome - almost gametime)
Dave Glass: Well, hello, everybody. Dave Glass talkin' at ya. We've got great weather here tonight under the Dome.
Marge Simpson: Let's see. Upper, upper, upper mezzanine. Hmmm. Yes, these must be ours.
Bart Simpson: These seats stink!
Marge Simpson: You'd think the player's wives would be a little closer to the action.
First Wife #3: Actually, this section is for the player's ex-wives.
First Wife #1: (TO WOMAN NEXT TO HER) And then I found out that all the while there was this bimbo in Kansas City.
First Wife #3: Throw at his head!
Homer Simpson: Who'd've thought it? A free ticket to a big league park but I was too tense to enjoy the game. Every ounce of concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.
Hot Dog Man: Red hots! Get your read hots here!
Homer Simpson: Oooh, red hots.
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen. Capital City's newest sensation, Dancin' Homer!
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. (WITH HIS MOUTH FULL) Uh oh.
Lisa Simpson: (POINTING) There he is!
Homer Simpson: I was graceful. I was witty. Brother, I was somethin'.
Homer Simpson: But they didn't care.
Bart Simpson: What's with these people? Why are they sitting on their hands?
Lisa Simpson: Mom, what's he doing wrong?
Marge Simpson: I don't know.
Homer Simpson: It was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.
Spectator #1: This guy doesn't make me want to cheer.
Spectator #2: Gee, I really pity him. Making a fool of himself in front of so many people.
Spectator #3: These cornball antics may play in the sticks, but this is Capital City!
Homer Simpson: The only applause I got was for dragging my carcass out of there.
Clubhouse Attendant: Hey, Mr. Showmanship! The owner wants to see you in his office right now.
Dave Rosenfield: I'm sorry, young man; you're just not ready. Pick up your check at the front office... and for God's sake, put some clothes on!
(STADIUM: ext. stadium - players and mascot entrance)
Bart Simpson: Well, I guess it's back to good old Springfield.
Marge Simpson: Would you like some fruit juice?
BURNS LAWYER: No.
Lisa Simpson: But I can't go back! Not after I've seen the bright lights of Capital City. I'll wither and die like a hothouse flower.
Marge Simpson: Now stop it you two. And don't look too down. I'm sure this is hard enough for your father.
Homer Simpson: What a family.
(Freeway: ext. freeway - night)
Homer Simpson: My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home I realized how little that helped.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Homer Simpson: (SIGHS) So that's it. The costume's buried now. As my son would say, I'm one sad ape-like dude.
Barney Gumble: Wow.
Moe Szyslak: What a saga.
Homer Simpson: Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I've become the center of attention.
Barney Gumble: Yeah, it's riveting. (BURP)
Moe Szyslak: Tell it again, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Okay. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
Moe Szyslak: I don't know. They just do.
(Simpson Front Yard: EXT. SIMPSON front yard - SATURDAY AFTERNOON)
Homer Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Bust my hump all week... stupid grass... supposed to be the boy's job.
Marge Simpson: Now, now, Homer. Bart's busy working on his science project.
Bart Simpson: You heard the lady, Homer. So please mow quietly. Genius at work.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bart's bedroom)
Bart Simpson: (WRITING) "One o'clock -- still just a potato.
Ned Flanders: (PLEASANTLY) Hey there, neighbor! The Lord's certainly given us a beautiful day today. Huh?
Homer Simpson: (NOT REAL FRIENDLY) H'lo, Flanders.
Ned Flanders: Doing a little yard work, huh?
Homer Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Who told? (CALLING TO MARGE) Marge! Beer me!
Ned Flanders: Say Simpson, I-I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif.
Homer Simpson: Crabgrass? What are you talking about? Where?
Ned Flanders: Well, (POINTING) ooh, there... there... and uh there's a big patch over there.
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) There's nothing wrong with crabgrass! It just has a bad name, that's all. Everyone would love it if it had a cute name like... uh... elfgrass.
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Well, you may be right!
Homer Simpson: (HOLLERING) Marge! Where's the Duff?
Homer Simpson: (THROUGH HIS TEETH) Don't toy with me, woman.
Ned Flanders: Couldn't help overhearing, Simpson. I've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me.
Homer Simpson: Well, uh, okay. What the heck, I've earned a little break.
(Flanders Home: int. flanders house - basement/rUMPUS ROOm - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Holy moly! It's... it's... beautiful!
Ned Flanders: Say, that's right. This is your first visit to the Flanders homestead.
Homer Simpson: Well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, (COUNTING ALL OF HIS FINGERS) one, two, three, four... eight years.
Ned Flanders: There's my little Popcorn Ball. Kissy, kissy.
Maude Flanders: Hello, Sponge Cake. I thought you boys might be hungry, so I whipped up some club sandwiches.
Ned Flanders: Ain't she wonderful, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, Flanders?
Ned Flanders: Oh, your beer. Uh, is draft okay? Just put in the tap last week.
Ned Flanders: Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland.
Homer Simpson: Well, beggars can't be choosy.
Todd Flanders: Hey, Dad, thanks for helping me with my science project. (KISSES HIS FATHER)
Ned Flanders: My pleasure, Study Buddy.
Todd Flanders: I've got the best Dad in the whole world.
Ned Flanders: (CHIDING) Oh, you know how that embarrasses me.
Todd Flanders: I know. T'oodley doodley.
Ned Flanders: (TO HOMER) Ah, kids can be a trial sometimes.
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) All right, knock it off!
Ned Flanders: Uh, knock what off, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here. Your family is better than my family. Your beer comes from farther away than my beer. You and your son like each other. Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. You make me sick!
Ned Flanders: (FORMALLY) Simpson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand.
Homer Simpson: I wouldn't stay on a bet!
Homer Simpson: One for the road.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Marge Simpson: Homie, quit tossing.
Bart Simpson: Play it where it lays, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, Marge. But it's just that I'm still steamed up about that jerk Flanders. (GRUMBLING) Lousy... bragging... know-it-all... show-off...
Marge Simpson: What exactly did he say?
Homer Simpson: Get this. He said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!
Marge Simpson: Well, how did he say it?
Homer Simpson: (MUTTERING) Well... he...
Marge Simpson: Was he angry?
Homer Simpson: No.
Marge Simpson: Was he rude?
Homer Simpson: Okay, okay. It wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!
Marge Simpson: Homer, I'm your best friend, but I've gotta say, I've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor.
Homer Simpson: Oh, he's perfect now, is he?
Marge Simpson: Well, he's not perfect, but he is very...
Homer Simpson: No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You were right the first time. He's perfect. Perfect in every way.
Homer Simpson: I'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. I got a little excited. (POINTED) I'm not perfect... like Ned Flanders.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
(Flanders Home: int. flanders house - master bedroom - continuous)
Maude Flanders: Neddie, you're tossing. What's the matter?
Ned Flanders: I feel terrible.
Maude Flanders: Mmmm, hmmm...
Ned Flanders: Sometimes I forget that we have things a little better than the Simpsons. I drag him over here. He has a few beers. You can't blame him for erupting.
Maude Flanders: Mmmm, hmmm.
Ned Flanders: And then I turn into a snarling beast. Talk about flunking the old turn-the-other-cheek test!
Maude Flanders: Well, Ned, maybe I'm not the one you should be talking to.
NED: You're right.
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Reverend Lovejoy.
(Lovejoy Bedroom: int. reverend lovejoy's bedroom)
Helen Lovejoy: (INTO PHONE) No, this is Mrs. Lovejoy. Just a minute. (TO REVEREND) Honey, honey, wake up. It sounds like Ned Flanders is having some sort of crisis.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ugh, probably stepped on a worm. (INTO PHONE) Hello, Ned.
Ned Flanders: Hey, there's Homer Simpson! Oh, what a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter.
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) Reverend, I'm sorry to bother you at this hour but I threw a man out of my house today. I feel like I've violated Matthew 19:19.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (INTO PHONE) Huh?
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) "Love thy neighbor."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (INTO PHONE) Oh. Oh. Matthew, 19:19, yeah, right, right. Well, you know, Ned. The Good Book says a gentle answer turneth away wrath.
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) A gentle answer. Well, that is a jim-dandy idea. Bless you, Reverend.
Ned Flanders: (WRITING) "Dear Neighbor..."
(Simpson Home: ext. Simpson house - night)
Homer Simpson: Flanders!
Ned Flanders: I don't blame you for being upset with me, Homer. I just wanted to give you this letter. I'll leave now.
Homer Simpson: (READING) "Dear neighbor... "
Homer Simpson: (READING, LAUGHING) "You are my brother. I love you (LAUGHS) and yet I feel a great sadness (BEAT) in my bosom."
Homer Simpson: Wait! Wait! There's more...
Marge Simpson: I think it's terrible. A man opens his heart and you make fun of him.
Homer Simpson: (READING, LAUGHING) "Neighbors forever. Oh, no! Ned Flanders."
Bart Simpson: What a sap!
Lisa Simpson: Read the bosom part again, Dad.
Marge Simpson: Now, just a minute.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHING) Bosom!
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Huh?
Marge Simpson: I wish this family was as close as the Flanders.
Homer Simpson: Okay, okay, all right, all right. She's right! Let's do something together. What does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?
Bart Simpson: All right!
Marge Simpson: Hmmm. I was going to wash my hair.
Lisa Simpson: And I'm studying for the Math Fair. If I win, I'll bring home a brand new protractor.
Homer Simpson: Too bad we don't live on a farm. (TO BART) Let's go, boy.

Homer Simpson: (WHINY PROTEST) But I got it in the middle!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) That was just a practice shot, boy.
Bart Simpson: Give up, Homeboy. There's a six-stroke limit.
Homer Simpson: I know, I know. I can still make this for five. (CONCENTRATES) Come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. Pleeze. (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Ned Flanders: Hi, Simpson! Having fun?
Homer Simpson: Flanders! What are you doing here?
Ned Flanders: Ah, just playing a little mini-golf with the Todd-meister.
Todd Flanders: (FRIENDLY) Hi, Bart!
Bart Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Get bent.
Ned Flanders: Say, now that we're all friends again, why don't we make a foursome?
Ned Flanders: All right! This will be fun! Oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there.
Homer Simpson: That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it.
Todd Flanders: It is difficult, Mr. Simpson. The best strategy is to play conservatively. Hug the rail. It won't go in, but you set yourself up for an easy deuce.
Todd Flanders: Oh, well, huh, it went in.
Ned Flanders: Good shot, Toddsky!
Homer Simpson: (ASIDE TO BART) Luck.
Bart Simpson: Final score: Bart, forty-one. Homer... let's see, six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six...
Homer Simpson: Never mind!
Todd Flanders: Hey, look!
Todd Flanders: Wow! First prize, fifty dollars!
Bart Simpson: Wow! Free balloons for everyone who enters!
Ned Flanders: So, my little Bartley, thinking of entering the tournament?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, he's entering and what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?
Bart Simpson: (HALFHEARTEDLY) I guess it's possible.
Ned Flanders: Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah! Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week.
Homer Simpson: Come on, boy.
Bart Simpson: But Dad, I've never won anything in my life.
Homer Simpson: Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this. It is not okay to lose.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BACKYARD - THE NEXT MORNING)
Marge Simpson: (IRRITATED) You brought food...
Homer Simpson: (TO SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER) Stay, stay. Good dog. Now, keep your head down.
Homer Simpson: No, not you. I'm talking to the boy. (TO BART) Keep your head down. Follow through...
Homer Simpson: Okay, that didn't work. This time move your head and don't follow through.
Bart Simpson: Oh, man.
Homer Simpson: (OUTRAGED) What're you doing? That putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player, what a violin is to the guy tha...the violin guy. Now, c'mon, give your putter a name.
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: Come on, give it a name.
Bart Simpson: (TIMIDLY) Mr. Putter.
Homer Simpson: Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on, give it a girl's name.
Bart Simpson: Mom.
Homer Simpson: (GRUFFLY) Your putter's name is Charlene!
Bart Simpson: Why?
Homer Simpson: It just is. That's why.
Homer Simpson: Now, this is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders. Every day I want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him.
Bart Simpson: Who's Charlene?
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) I'll show you who Charlene is! Now start hating!
Todd Flanders: (FRIENDLY) Hi, Bart.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - day)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I couldn't help overhearing you warp Bart's mind.
Homer Simpson: And?
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament.
Homer Simpson: But, Marge, this is our big chance to show up the Flanderses.
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?
Homer Simpson: Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. (BITTERLY) And I'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
(Bart's Bedroom: int. bart's bedroom - day)

Bart Simpson: Absolutely. Eeeeeeeer! (CRASH SOUND)
(Street: EXT. street - DAY)
Lisa Simpson: Well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but I think you're referring to a pawn.
Bart Simpson: Right. I am a pawn.
Lisa Simpson: I know. It's times like this that I'm thankful Dad has little to no interest in almost everything I do. Bart, I think I can help you.

Lisa Simpson: Let's see, "golf"... Anecdotes, Eisenhower and, Fashion, Humor, Japanese Obsession With... ah, here it is. Putting.
(LIBRARY STACKS: int. library stacks - oriental philosophy section - later)
Lisa Simpson: And, finally, the most important book of all, The Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu.
Bart Simpson: Lisa, we can't afford all these books.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, we're just gonna borrow them.
Bart Simpson: (WINKS; SLYLY) Oh, heh, heh. Gotcha.
(Lake Springfield: ext. lake springfield - day)
Lisa Simpson: I want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.
Bart Simpson: Okay.
Lisa Simpson: Embrace nothingness.
Bart Simpson: You got it.
Lisa Simpson: Become like an uncarved stone.
Bart Simpson: Done.
Lisa Simpson: Bart! You're just pretending to know what I'm talking about.
Bart Simpson: True.
Lisa Simpson: Well, it's very frustrating.
Bart Simpson: I'll bet.
(TOP OF MOUNT SPRINGFIELD: ext. top of mount springfield - day)
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I have a riddle for you: What's the sound of one hand clapping?
Bart Simpson: Piece of cake.
Lisa Simpson: No, Bart. It's a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer. It's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought.
Bart Simpson: No answer? Lisa, listen up.
Lisa Simpson: Let's try another one: If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?
Homer Simpson: I said NOW!
Lisa Simpson: But Bart, how can a sound exist if there's no one there to hear it?
Bart Simpson: Woooooooo!
Lisa Simpson: It is time.
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - day)
Lisa Simpson: The basis of this game seems to be simple geometry. All you have to do is hit the ball here.
Bart Simpson: I can't believe it... You've actually found a practical use for geometry.
Homer Simpson: Bart! What're you doing? Get down from there before the neighbors see --
Ned Flanders: Hey, Simpson.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Flanders, I don't care what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt.
Ned Flanders: (CLINGING TO HIS DECENCY) Well, sir, may the best man win.
Homer Simpson: Ah, "may the best man win". The mating call of the loser.
Ned Flanders: Now, just a minute, Simpson. I think my son has a very good chance.
Homer Simpson: Oh, yeah? Wanna bet?
Ned Flanders: Yeah, well, I'm not a betting man.
Ned Flanders: Oh, I'm a chicken, am I?
Homer Simpson: That's right!
Ned Flanders: All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!
Homer Simpson: What, are you afraid to make a real bet?
Ned Flanders: No, I just --
Ned Flanders: (GETTING ANGRY) You know, Simpson, you're starting to annoy me.
Homer Simpson: How about this Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn.
Ned Flanders: (EVEN ANGRIER) All right, and if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a change!
Homer Simpson: Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress.
Ned Flanders: (SCREAMING) You have yourself a bet, you (BEAT) jackaninny!
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - day)
Homer Simpson: Read that back to me, Marge.
Marge Simpson: (READS) "The father of the loser mows the lawn -- "
Ned Flanders: (INTERRUPTS) Eh, eh, just a minute. "Loser" is such a harsh word. Couldn't we just say "the boy who doesn't win"?
Homer Simpson: Oh man. Fine.
Marge Simpson: (WRITING) "The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress."
Ned Flanders: There you go.
Marge Simpson: Now I suppose you both have to sign this. I hope blood won't be necessary.
Homer Simpson: I'm game if you are, Flanders.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - minutes later)
Ned Flanders: (SIGHS) Good gravy, what have I done?
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - day)
Homer Simpson: Keep your left arm straight, Bart... rotate your shoulders...
Lisa Simpson: Dad!
Homer Simpson: (GENTLY) Look, son, all I'm asking is that you try.
Bart Simpson: Okay, I'll try.
Homer Simpson: (SCORNFUL) Anybody can try! I want you to win!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Marge Simpson: Homer?!
Homer Simpson: Marge, give me your honest opinion. (HOLDS UP A DRESS) This? (HOLDS UP THE OTHER ONE) Or this?
(Springfield: ext. Springfield - establishing - dawn)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bart's bedroom)
Homer Simpson: Good morning, son! Oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!
Lisa Simpson: Dad!
Homer Simpson: See you downstairs, boy.
Homer Simpson: Heh heh... that crazy Marmaduke...
Lisa Simpson: Eighth hole.
Bart Simpson: (AUTOMATICALLY) Aim for the Octopus' third tentacle.
Lisa Simpson: Twelfth hole.
Bart Simpson: Bank it off the pink tombstone.
Lisa Simpson: Nirvana.
Bart Simpson: A state of bliss attained through the extinction of the self.
Marge Simpson: Here you go, Bart. A lumberjack's breakfast for my little golfer.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, Bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates. Steak will make him logy.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh, well, what won't make him logy?
Lisa Simpson: Oatmeal.
Homer Simpson: Oatmeal?
Lisa Simpson: Oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the Kentucky Derby.
Homer Simpson: News flash, Lisa! Bart is not a horse. Eat your steak, boy.
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - afternoon)
Bart Simpson: Mom, do I have to?
British Commentator: Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the finale of what has already been a stirring afternoon of miniature golf. The cream has risen, the wheat has bid farewell to the chaff, and now we approach the championship match with but two warriors remaining: The heretofore unknown Bart Simpson, and Todd Flanders, one of the most skilled ten-year-olds to ever take back the blade.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself, I'm not sure how they're supposed to sound. But here goes. I believe in you.
Bart Simpson: Thanks, man!
Homer Simpson: Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying. I already did the same thing, and we can't both win.
Ned Flanders: (THROUGH CLENCHED TEETH) Actually, Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt.
Homer Simpson: Oh... Well, Flan-ders, it doesn't matter. This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels.
Ned Flanders: No, you will.
Homer Simpson: 'Fraid not.
Ned Flanders: 'Fraid so.
Homer Simpson: 'Fraid not.
Ned Flanders: 'Fraid so.
Homer Simpson: (SMUGLY) 'Fraid not infinity.
Ned Flanders: 'Fraid so infinity plus one.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(MINIATURE GOLF: ext. miniature golf - first hole - continuous)
British Commentator: Young Flanders has the honor and will tee off first.
British Commentator: It's got a chance... (BALL GOES IN) Yes, sir!
Bart Simpson: (DESPAIRINGLY) Oh, man...
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in...
British Commentator: And the battle is well and truly joined!
Homer Simpson: Woo-hoo-hoo! (TO FLANDERS)
Ned Flanders: (TO TODD) Mercy is for the weak, Todd.
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - hole 18 - late afternoon)
British Commentator: If one were to look up "courage" in the Oxford English Dictionary, one might very well come upon a photo of these two gladiators. They approach the final hole in the shadow of the great emancipator, deadlocked at eight strokes on the happy side of par. Soon, one man will emerge triumphant. He will drink naught but champagne, while his opponent tastes bitter defeat in this oft cruel game.
Ned Flanders: It's okay, son. You can recover.
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF, PLEADING) Come on, Bart. Remember what Vince Lombardi said: "If you lose, you're out of the family."
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Ow.
British Commentator: Neither man showing his best form... This sort of pressure can unhinge even the steeliest of competitors.
Bart Simpson: This is pretty tense, isn't it, Todd?
Todd Flanders: Yeah, my knees are shaking, I've got butterflies in my stomach... but I guess this builds character.
Bart Simpson: Who wants to build character. Let's quit.
Todd Flanders: Okay.
Todd Flanders: We decided we're equally good.
Bart Simpson: We want to call it a draw, man.
British Commentator: (ANNOUNCING) Ladies and gentlemen, we have a draw!
British Commentator: (TEARFULLY) You will forgive an old Brit for crying, but this is the most stirring display of gallantry and sportsmanship since Mountbatten gave India back to the Punjabs.
Bart Simpson: Put her there, man!
Todd Flanders: Yeah, all right!
Ned Flanders: Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. (CHUCKLES) Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. (EXTENDING HIS HAND) Put 'er there, pal.
Homer Simpson: Ohhh, so you're gonna welch on our bet?!
Ned Flanders: What are you talking about? Neither boy lost.
Homer Simpson: I got it right here in writing.
Homer Simpson: (READING) "The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress."
Ned Flanders: (DISBELIEVING) But... neither, I mean we're both... I mean, you have to do it too.
Homer Simpson: It's a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself.
(SIMPSON AND FLANDERS HOUSES: ext. simpson and flanders houses - day)
Marge Simpson: (MOANING) Oh, my best dress.
Lisa Simpson: Why do I get the feeling that someday I'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?
Homer Simpson: Listen to 'em laughing... This is so humiliating... I'm never gonna live this down... Damn Flanders...
Homer Simpson: Halftime, Marge, halftime.
Patty Bouvier: Ding-dong!
Ned Flanders: (LAUGHING) Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Oh my God! He's enjoying it!
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: (MUFFLED) Bart, cut it out!
Homer Simpson: Bart! Stop fighting with your sister!
Bart Simpson: She took my glue!
Lisa Simpson: It's not yours, Bart! This is family glue!
Homer Simpson: Stop it, you two! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, this isn't about glue. It's about territoriality. He only wants the glue because I'm using it.
Bart Simpson: Oh yeah? Prove it!
Lisa Simpson: Here.
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, I don't want your stupid glue.
Marty: (FROM TV) Uh-oh. Here comes our friend, Bullwinkle J. Moose...
Homer Simpson: Heh... heh... heh. Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.
Bill: (FROM TV; RE: ANTLER) Uh-oh... it looks like ol' Bullwinkle's kinda got a taste of his own medicine!
Marty: (FROM TV) (LAUGHING) He certainly did, Bill!
Bill: (FROM TV; TO SELF) Wait, what did that mean? Did what I say make sense?
Marty: (FROM TV) Well... no... not really, Bill!
Bill: (FROM TV; CHUCKLES) Boy, now I know how the Pilgrims felt.
Marty: (FROM TV) What're you talking about, Bill?
Bart Simpson: Who the hell is that?
Homer Simpson: Bullwinkle.
Bart Simpson: Who? (BEAT) Wait a minute, who's that?
Homer Simpson: Underdog! Don't you know anything?
Bart Simpson: Well, I know it wouldn't hurt 'em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years.
Homer Simpson: Son, this is a tradition. If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce.
Lisa Simpson: Maggie, I'm about to unveil my centerpiece to the family!
Selma Bouvier: Here comes the cavalry!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Marge Simpson: Homer, you promised to be nice to my sisters.

Maggie Simpson: (SUCKS PACIFIER)
Lisa Simpson: As one of the Simpson women, would you like to contribute something to it?
Lisa Simpson: (HUGS MAGGIE) Oh, thank you.
Marge Simpson: Honey, please. You're in the way.
Bart Simpson: Can't I help you, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Well, okay. Let's see... Can you do the cranberry sauce?
Bart Simpson: Yeah! Where is it?
Marge Simpson: The can is in the cupboard on the bottom shelf.
Bart Simpson: Here?
Marge Simpson: (DIRECTING HIM) No, no, no, the other shelf.
Bart Simpson: Got it. Now what?
Marge Simpson: Open the can.
Bart Simpson: No problemo. Where's the can opener?
Marge Simpson: It's in the second drawer from the right.
Marge Simpson: No, no, no, no, the other one.

Marge Simpson: Just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done. Bart. Bart?

Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR; DEADLY TONE) You knew that I was cooking a turkey.
Patty Bouvier: Which is fine!
Selma Bouvier: More power to ya!
Patty Bouvier: It's just that some people find your turkey a little dry.
Selma Bouvier: Mmm-hmm, and if they want an option... they'll have it.

Announcer: (FROM TV) And the Silverdome, now ablaze with flashbulbs, as "Hurray for Everything" leaves the field! Of course, a stadium's much too big for flash pictures to work, but nobody seems to care!

Jacqueline Bouvier: (WHISPERING) Leave me alone.
Selma Bouvier: How long did that take you, honey?
Lisa Simpson: I couldn't tell you how many hours. It was a labor of love. It's my homage to some American heroes who may not have fought in any wars, but who nevertheless...
Bart Simpson: Da da daah da da dah daaahhh...
Homer Simpson: Speaking of heroes, here's mine... Tom Turkey!
Bart Simpson: Yikes! What is that?

Marge Simpson: Yes, you do! I hope you're happy, Bart! You've RUINED THANKSGIVING!
Bart Simpson: (FUMING) I didn't ruin Thanksgiving! She did... Buncha jerks... I always get blamed for everything...
Homer Simpson: ...And, Lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. You saw what happened. Oh, Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?

Bart Simpson: Why should I?
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern - continuous)
Barney Gumble: But I only got up to go to the can.
Homer Simpson: Damn, no spots.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, the only reason to apologize is if you look deep down inside yourself and you find a spot, something you wish wasn't there, because you feel bad you hurt your sister's feelings.
Bart Simpson: Leave me alone!
Lisa Simpson: (STRIDENT) Just look!
Bart Simpson: Okay... okay.
Bart Simpson: Hmmm, hmmm. Looking for the spot... Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm... Still checking. This is so stupid... I'm not gonna find anything... Just because I wrecked something she worked really hard on and I made her cr... Uh-oh!

(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern - day)
Homer Simpson: Rasputin's got the reach, but on the other hand, the Professor's got his patented coma lock. If you ask me, this is gonna be one hell of a match.

MURDOCK: (CHUCKLES) I almost forgot. To add a real element of danger, one drop of human blood.
MURDOCK: On the chance that I don't survive, let me just say, seat belts save lives so buckle up.

(HOSPITAL WARD: Int. hospital ward - day)

Marge Simpson: Gee, I never realized TV was such a dangerous influence.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, as tragic as all this is, it's a small price to pay for countless hours of top-notch entertainment.

(Springfield Gorge: Ext. Springfield GORGE - continuous)
SMYTHE: Hello, children, and welcome to Springfield Gorge.

MURDOCK: Ow! Doc, I heard a snap.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hmm. I'm afraid the bone's broken. Well, that's all of them.
MURDOCK: Don't worry, partner. I've broken that thumb dozens of times. Hey, I bet you'd like an autograph. Nurse.
MURDOCK: (WITH PEN IN MOUTH) Who should I make this out to?
Bart Simpson: Just Bart will be fine, sir.

MURDOCK: (TO NURSE AND DOCTOR) Could you leave me with the young'uns, please?
Bart Simpson: What's the matter?
Homer Simpson: You didn't mean that. Bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises I don't expect you to keep. If you make this promise, you have to keep it.
Bart Simpson: Why?
(SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY: ext. side of the highway)
MURDOCK: Now let me start by saying... good for you, son. It's always good to see young people taking an interest in danger. Now, a lot of people are gonna be telling you you're crazy, and maybe they're right. But the fact of the matter is: bones heal, chicks dig scars, and the United States of America has the best doctor to daredevil ratio in the world.
Lisa Simpson: But Captain Murdock!
Bart Simpson: Thanks, Lance.
MURDOCK: You're welcome, little pardner. On your way out, tell the nurse I'm ready for my sponge bath. (WINKS AT BART) Another fringe benefit. Nurse.

Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry, Bart. But if you got hurt or died, despite the extra attention I'd receive, I'd miss you.
Bart Simpson: Bart, I forbid you to jump over that gorge.
Bart Simpson: You can't.
Homer Simpson: I can and do. Go to your room, Bart! There, I've done it. I'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all.
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but there's no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and headin' for that gorge.
Homer Simpson: He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you're his father. You've got to try and reason with him.
Homer Simpson: Oh, that never works. He's a goner.
Marge Simpson: (EXASPERATED) Oh, come on, Homer. A heart to heart talk with your son, you've got to try.

Homer Simpson: BART!
Bart Simpson: Hey, what gives?
Homer Simpson: Boy, I've tried ordering you, I've tried punishing you, and God help me, I even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself.
Bart Simpson: What? Why?
Homer Simpson: Because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.
Bart Simpson: (WORRIED) But, Dad, you'll never make it.
Homer Simpson: Don't you think I know that?
Homer Simpson: Goodbye, son.
Bart Simpson: Wait, dad. Don't do it. I won't jump anymore, I promise.

Marge Simpson: What do we want?
Marge Simpson: HER GROUP
Marge Simpson: (CHANTING) Substantially-less
Marge Simpson: violence-in children's-program-ming.
Marge Simpson: KRUSTY
Marge Simpson: (OVER CHANTING) No! You're ruining the show. Oh... Oh... Oh. Stop.
Marge Simpson: Please stop. Please. Be quiet.
Marge Simpson: Oh, please. All right. I'm trying to earn a living here. All right! Stop! Stop!
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (GRUFFLY) That woman. That screwball, Marge Simpson. We've got to stop her. But how?
Animator: (QUICKLY) Drop an anvil on her?
1ST BOARD MEMBER: Hit her on the head with a piano?
2nd Board Member: Stuff her full of TNT, then throw a match down her throat and run?
Roger Meyers, Jr.: All your fancy degrees and that's the best you can do? You make me sick.
(I & S INTERNATIONAL: ext. I & s international - FRONT GATE)
Animator: Hmmm. Ah ha! I'm so funny.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson HOUSE - living room - a week later)
Homer Simpson: You know, some of these stories are pretty good. I never know mice lived such interesting lives.
Marge Simpson: So much needless brutality. I don't know if I'm having any impact at all.
Squirrel: (MARGE-LIKE VOICE) Don't do that! Don't do that! Hey! Don't DO that!
Homer Simpson: (LAUGHING) Take that you dumb squirrel.
Marge Simpson: (SEETHING) Mmmmmmmph!
Homer Simpson: (LAUGHING) Where do they get their ideas?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE, TESTY) What is it? What? "Smartline?" Yes, I've heard of your late-night panel discussion show. (LISTENS, STILL ANGRY) Well, I'd love to.
Announcer #2: "Smartline!" With our local Emmy-award winning, host... Kent Brockman.
Lisa Simpson: (POINTING) There she is!
(TV Studio: int. tv studio - set of "smartline")
Roger Meyers, Jr.: Thank you.
Krusty the Clown: Hi, Kent! (KRUSTY LAUGH)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Hiya.
Bart Simpson: Me and the guys went fishing. Almost caught a catfish this big. (STRETCHES ARMS WIDE)
Roger Meyers, Jr.: There's nothing wrong with it.
Marge Simpson: (UNCOMFORTABLE, EYEING CAMERA) Excuse me. Excuse me. He was addressing me.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: I know. There's nothing wrong with it.
Marge Simpson: Excuse me. There is! I think that it's a bad influence on children.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: Oh, give me a break! I think that is a bunch of baloney. And here's why. In preparing for this debate, I did a little research and I discovered a startling thing. There was violence in the past, long before cartoons were invented.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: Yeah, and there was something called the Crusades, for instance. Tremendous violence! Many people killed! The darn thing went on for thirty years.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: That's right, Kent. (TO MARGE) So much for your viewpoint.
Marge Simpson: (SNORTS)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Ah, well, Kent... to me, the high jinks - of a few comic characters absolutely pale in comparison with the crippling emotional problems a psychiatrist runs into every day. I'm… I'm referring here to women who love too much, fear of winning, sexaholism... stuff like that.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, not at all. In fact, one of my guilty little pleasures is to snuggle up with a big bucket of buttered popcorn, dim the lights, turn on Itchy & Scratchy, and laugh myself silly. And what the hell is wrong with that?
Krusty the Clown: (KRUSTY LAUGH) Hi kids!!! (KRUSTY LAUGHS AGAIN)
Krusty the Clown: (APOLOGETICALLY) Oh. I'm sorry, Kent. It's just that when the camera gets on me... (NOTICES CAMERA)... HEY HEY!!! (KRUSTY LAUGH)
Krusty the Clown: Oh.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh.
Marge Simpson: Yes. I'd like to ask all the parents in Springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel. Thank you.
(I & S INTERNATIONAL: int. I & s international - board room - NEXT DAY)
Roger Meyers, Jr.: I don't believe this... "I will never watch your show, buy any of your products... or brake if I see you crossing the street." Wow, that's cold.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: "Dear Sleaze Merchant" -- Now, come on, that hurts.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: Gentlemen, the screwballs have spoken.

Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) Is this Marge Simpson?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: The Marge Simpson who fixed it so cartoons can't be violent anymore?
Marge Simpson: (THROUGH PHONE) Yes?
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) This is Myers. I'm here with the writers. Listen, you're so smart, how do we end this picture?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Well... what's the problem you're having?
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) Okay, here it is. Itchy just stole Scratchy's ice cream cone...
Animator: (INTERRUPTING) Make it a pie. Pies are easier to draw.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) Okay, a pie. Anyway, Scratchy is understandably upset.
Marge Simpson: Huh huh.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: So we figured he could - you know - just grab Itchy and toss him in a bucket of acid.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh dear!
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) But then we remembered that this might be interpreted as violence which is morally wrong now, thanks to you. So what's your big idea? How do we end this?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Well... let's see... Oh! couldn't Itchy share his pie with Scratchy? Then they would both have pie.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (THOUGHTFULLY LOOKING AT THE STORYBOARD) It's different, I'll give you that.

Bart Simpson: Borrowed?
Announcer: It's an asphalt spreader! It's sixty- seven tools in one! How much would you pay for a machine that can do all this?
Homer Simpson: One thousand dollars.
Announcer: Don't answer yet...
Homer Simpson: Oh, sorry.
Announcer: ... because you also get...
Homer Simpson: (MILD PROTEST) I was watching that.

Scratchy: Lemonade?
Itchy: Please!
Scratchy: I made it just for you.
Itchy: You are my best friend.
Lisa Simpson: Itchy and Scratchy seem to have lost their edge.
Marge Simpson: I think it conveys a very nice message of sharing.
Bart Simpson: I think it sucks.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAM) ... Oh, hey, thank you, Maggie.
Itchy: Mmmm, this really hits the spot.
Scratchy: Doesn't it though?
Itchy: You really make good lemonade, Scratchy.
Scratchy: Oh, oh, oh. Thank you, Itchy.
Krusty the Clown: Wasn't that funny, boys and girls? (FRUSTRATED) (A LITTLE TOUGH) Well? Wasn't it?
Marge Simpson: Aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?

Homer Simpson: Sit down, boy!
Lisa Simpson: And Janey and I went bird watching. We saw a grackle.
Marge Simpson: That's nice dear.
Bart Simpson: Come on, Lis. Let's go finish our soapbox racers.
Lisa Simpson: Okay. May we please be excused?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Homer Simpson: (AWE) Wow. What great kids. This is the golden age, Marge. And the parents of Springfield owe it all to you.

Marge Simpson: (SLEEPILY) What in the world?
Helen Lovejoy: Get dressed, Marge. You've got to lead our protest against this abomination!
Marge Simpson: (MYSTIFIED) Hmmm, but that's Michelangelo's David. It's a masterpiece!
Helen Lovejoy: (CORRECTING HER) It's filth. It graphically portrays parts of the human body which - practical as they may be... are evil!
Marge Simpson: But I like that statue.
Helen Lovejoy: (GASPS)
Maude Flanders: I told you she was soft on full frontal nudity. Come on, girls.

Homer Simpson: Really? Great!
Marge Simpson: I'm not. I think everyone in Springfield should see it.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) Hmmm... yes and no.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Hold it, hold it, hold it... how can you be for one form of freedom of expression, like (INDICATES STATUE) our big naked friend over there, and be against another form, like Itchy and Scratchy?
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Kent Brockman: Good question.
Marge Simpson: (THINKS) Well... I guess I can't, which is a shame because I really hate those cartoons.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Oh yeah, well what do you have to say to all those Marge Simpson wannabes out there who wish to suppress David's doodle.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) Um, I don't know. I guess one person can make a difference, but most of the time, they probably shouldn't.
Kent Brockman: Well... I guess that settles that. I'd like to alert our affiliates that we will be ending our show early tonight. Join us tomorrow when our topic will be, "Religion: Which is the One True Faith?"

Homer Simpson: Oh. What's wrong, Marge?
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homie. Here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other.
Homer Simpson: Hey, don't worry Marge, pretty soon every boy and girl in Springfield Elementary School is gonna come and see this thing.
Marge Simpson: Really, why?

Bart Simpson: Hey, I'm innocent, man!
Devil: (CHUCKLING) Innocent. Everybody's innocent. Okay, let's just pull up your file here.
Devil: Okay... Hmmm. Seems to be a mistake. According to this, you're not due to arrive here until the next time the Yankees win the pennant, that's nearly a century from now. Ha, ha. Boy is my face red.

Bart Simpson: (A LITTLE TROUBLED) Um... say... is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here?

Lionel Hutz: It turns into a sponge when you put it in water.
Homer Simpson: Ooo, classy.
Lionel Hutz: I'd like to talk to you about bringing legal action against the fiend who did this to your boy.
Scratchy: (EVEN MORE AGONIZED SHRIEK)
Homer Simpson: Well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. And besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. Nothing serious.
Lionel Hutz: (SCOFFING) Doctors! Doctors are idiots! There's no telling what kind of permanent injuries he might have. You might have to wait on him hand and foot (POKING HOMER IN THE CHEST AT EACH WORD) for the rest of his natural life!
Lionel Hutz: That's the downside. Now here's the good part. You can ching-ching-ching cash in on this tragedy.
Homer Simpson: (MASSAGING HIS CHEST) Wow...
Lisa Simpson: Excuse me, Mr. Hutz. Are you a shyster?
Lionel Hutz: How does a nice little girl like you know a big word like that?
Marge Simpson: Mr. Hutz, this is hardly the time or place to discuss this.
Lionel Hutz: You're right, you're right. When you feel up to it, come over to my office and we'll talk about it.
Lionel Hutz: (FADING) Lionel Hutz, Attorney-At-Law. What's that, a broken neck? Great!
Lisa Simpson: Hello, Dr. Hibbert.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hello, Lisa. (TO BART) Well, we've got a nasty bump on our head, haven't we?
Bart Simpson: Ow! Quit it!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: And a little tiny broken toe. (WRIGGLES BART'S BROKEN TOE)
Bart Simpson: Ow! Quit it!

Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hmm. Better let him rest up awhile first.

Homer Simpson: W-well... It's a v-very generous offer, sir. But... his medical bills alone...
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, so extortion is the name of your little game, is it Simpson? (GRABBING CHECK) Very well. Then you get nothing. I have the finest lawyers in Springfield, Simpson. (THE LAWYERS NOD SMUGLY) Tangle with me and I'll crush you like a paper cup.

Homer Simpson: (RESISTING) Fifty percent?
Lionel Hutz: You'll be getting more than just a lawyer, Mr. Simpson. You'll also be getting this exquisite faux pearl necklace -- a $99 value -- as our gift to you.

Homer Simpson: (BREAKING DOWN AGAIN) No!
Bart Simpson: But I played baseball this morning!
Marge Simpson: That's right, he did. Excuse me, but Dr. Hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought Bart was fine.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Dr. Hibbert from (SING-SONG) Johns Hopkins Medical School?
Lionel Hutz: With all due respect, Mrs. Simpson, you are not a doctor, the boy's not a doctor, I'm not a doctor. The only person in this room who even comes close is this man.

Bart Simpson: (INTIMIDATED) I am in constant pain.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, may I please make an observation?
Homer Simpson: Oh, what? What is it?
Lisa Simpson: I think this is all a charade to make Bart look more injured than he really is.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe Lisa does have a point. I don't mind you boys doing this in the living room, but in court doesn't Bart have to tell the truth?
Lionel Hutz: Yeah, but what is truth -- if you follow me. Now, Bart, can you roll your eyes back in your head like this?

Marge Simpson: What do you think, Homer?
Homer Simpson: I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks (SCREAMING) I'm an idiot. The only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.

Blue-Haired Lawyer: (FEIGNED SURPRISE) But, wait a minute! I'm confused! This court heard "expert" testimony from one Dr. Nick Riviera. What is your opinion of him?
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS UNCOMFORTABLY)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Mrs. Simpson...
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, but my mother always said, "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."
Homer Simpson: (TO HUTZ) Will that hold up in court?
Lionel Hutz: No, I've tried it before.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: (FORCEFULLY) Mrs. Simpson, what is your opinion of Dr. Riviera? And let me remind you that you're under oath.
Marge Simpson: Well, to be honest, he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping Bart in bandages than in making him feel better. And he mispronounced words that even I know, like abdomen. And his office was dirty. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure he's even a doctor.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: And Mrs. Simpson, could you describe for us in your own words Bart's (MAKES AIR QUOTES WITH FINGERS) "intense mental anguish and suffering"?
Marge Simpson: Well, I don't know how intense it was...
BURNS LAWYER: Huh uh.
Marge Simpson: ...but, well, I guess he did miss three days of school --
BURNS LAWYER: Oh, three days.
Marge Simpson: ...although he doesn't really like school all that much,
Marge Simpson: ...so I guess that may not count as anguish.
BURNS LAWYER: No, it doesn't.
Marge Simpson: It was a little hard on me having him around the house
BURNS LAWYER: Yes...
Marge Simpson: ...all that time.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships?
Marge Simpson: Well, we pay Bart five dollars a week to take out the trash...
BURNS LAWYER: Huh uh.
Marge Simpson: I suppose if he'd been able to do it that week, we might have given him the five dollars.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Five dollars?
Marge Simpson: Um-hmm.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: But your lawyer -- assuming he is a lawyer -- is asking for a million? (TO JURY) Well, we can't blame them for trying can we. Thank you very much, Mrs. Simpson.
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING) Oh, Marge.
(GLASS BOOTH: INT. GLASS BOOTH)
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm going to write a figure on this piece of paper. It's not quite as large as the last one, but I think you'll find it fair.
Lionel Hutz: I think we should take it.
Homer Simpson: (SHUDDERS)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - dining room)
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars.
Marge Simpson: Homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) Yeah, a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman. (FLATLY) No, thank you.
Marge Simpson: Some string beans?
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) No I don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. Uh oh I better answer. (FLATLY) No, thank you.
Marge Simpson: Some celery with cream cheese on it?
Homer Simpson: (UNINTELLIGIBLE MURMUR) (FLATLY) No, thank you.
Bart Simpson: You know what would've really been cool? If we got that million bucks.
Marge Simpson: Bart, please.
Bart Simpson: What? We could have bought tons of great stuff, Mom... maids, a pool, fancy sweaters... stop me if I'm wrong.
Homer Simpson: Marge, dear. Would it be all right if I went over to Moe's for a drink?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) I don't know if I'll ever come back here. (FLATLY) Goodnight.
Marge Simpson: (SHRIEK)
Marge Simpson: (THINKING) My woman's intuition is telling me something... I wonder what... Oh my god.
(Moe's Tavern: INT. MOE'S TAVERN)
Homer Simpson: Well, that's it. I guess this is the class I'm gonna die in.
Moe Szyslak: Eh, you're better off. Rich people aren't happy. From the day they're born, to the day they die, they think they're happy but, trust me... they ain't.
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) Moe, I wish he'd shut up.
Larry: Look, a chick!
Moe Szyslak: And it's not even Ladies Night.
Homer Simpson: Hey, hey, guys. Knock it off. It's just my wife.
Marge Simpson: (WITH THE ABOVE) My name is Marge. (TO HOMER)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Marge...
Marge Simpson: We've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- I mean, I know this is different than that time I washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but I--
Homer Simpson: (WITH TROUBLE) No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance.
Marge Simpson: What are you saying, Homer?
Homer Simpson: I'm saying... (THINKING) She's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. (TO MARGE) I'm not sure I love you anymore.
Marge Simpson: (GASPS)
Homer Simpson: But don't worry. I'll never let on. I'll still do all the bed stuff. Maybe it won't be so bad.
Marge Simpson: Oh my Lord. Well, I don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
Marge Simpson: Homer, look at me.
Homer Simpson: Alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her.
Homer Simpson: Oh, who am I kidding? I love you more than ever.
Marge Simpson: I love you too!
Senator Mendoza: McBain!!
Homer Simpson: Sorry to scare you like that, babe.
Moe Szyslak: Okay, everybody! For the next fifteen minutes, one third off on every pitcher... one per customer... domestic beer only... hey, no sharing!
(Simpson Kitchen: INT. SIMPSON KITCHEN - DINNERTIME)
Homer Simpson: Is it done yet? Is it done yet?
Marge Simpson: Your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? (COUNTING DOWN WITH TIMER) Four, three, two, one, ping!
Homer Simpson: We have meatloaf!
Marge Simpson: (CALLS OUT) Get it while it's unbelievably hot, kids!
Homer Simpson: (TEMPTINGLY) Yum. I've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) Thursday -- meatloaf night. As it was, is now, and ever shall be.
Homer Simpson: What are you getting at?
Lisa Simpson: Well, you're always trying to teach me to be opened-minded, try new things, live life to the...
Homer Simpson: What are you talking about? Nobody's trying to teach you that.
Homer Simpson: Shut up, boy.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe Lisa's right. Tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner.
Homer Simpson: Tomorrow night!? Friday!? Pork chop night!? Marge, we haven't missed pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) Friday night, pork chops. From cradle to grave... etched in stone in God's library somewhere...
Homer Simpson: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Where do you want to go?
Lisa Simpson: Anywhere but hamburgers, pizza or fried chicken.
Homer Simpson: Fine. We'll go to Mars.
Marge Simpson: There's that new sushi restaurant on Elm Street.
Bart Simpson: Sushi? Hey, maybe this is just one of those things you hear on the playground... but, isn't that raw fish?
Lisa Simpson: As usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point entirely. Sushi is considered quite a delicacy.
Marge Simpson: Please, Homer. Can't we try it?
Homer Simpson: No!
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad. This argument humiliates us both.
Homer Simpson: If I said no the first time, what makes you think I'm gonna say yes the second time?
Lisa Simpson: Nothing, but you might say yes the ninety-ninth time.
Homer Simpson: Oh, try me.
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad.
Homer Simpson: No!

Marge Simpson: What would you recommend for a family that's not sure they should be here?
Akira: The sushi sampler has a little bit of everything. It is very non-threatening.
Marge Simpson: I'll have one of those.
Lisa Simpson: Make it two.
Bart Simpson: Akira, my good man, I'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel.
Akira: Very good.
Bart Simpson: (TO AKIRA) Do you have any giant squid? The kind that drags men to their deaths?
Akira: Not today. (TO HOMER) And sir?
Homer Simpson: It's so hard to choose. It all looks so terrible. Just bring me (POINTING AT MENU) one of these, and one of these, and one of those.
(The Happy Sumo: Int. the happy sumo - kitchen)
Toshiro: What do you think, Master?
Master: No, no, no. Toshiro, the squid looks like it's been hacked by a blind woodsman. Hang your head in shame.
Homer Simpson: Good thing I'm open-minded. (PINCHES HIS NOSE)
Homer Simpson: Hmmm. Hmmm. Not bad. Interesting.
Homer Simpson: I'll try this little pink one, here. Hmmm, very good. Another one.

Homer Simpson: ... oh, oh, and two of these things.
Akira: Two uni.
Homer Simpson: And, Oh, Oh, I don't believe I've tried the flying fish roe...
Akira: I recommend it with a raw quail egg on top.
Homer Simpson: You're the doctor!
Bart Simpson: (SINGING IN LOW VOICE) "WHO'S THE BLACK PRIVATE DICK THAT'S THE SEX MACHINE TO ALL THE CHICKS?"

Bart Simpson: "You're damn right. WHO'S THE CAT THAT WON'T COP OUT / WHEN THERE'S DANGER ALL ABOUT?"
Lisa Simpson: "Shaft."
Bart Simpson: "Right on."
Homer Simpson: There's gotta be something I haven't tried. Huh? Hey! What's this? Fugu!
Akira: It is blowfish, sir. But I should warn you that one...
Homer Simpson: Come on, pal! Fugu me!
Bart Simpson: "THEY SAY THIS CAT SHAFT IS A BAD MOTHER..."
Lisa Simpson: "Shut your mouth!"
Bart Simpson: "But I'm talkin' about Shaft."
Lisa Simpson: "I can dig it!"
Bart Simpson: "HE'S A COMPLICATED MAN BUT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HIM BUT HIS WOMAN."
Lisa Simpson: "John Shaft."
Master: Oh, she's here. Cover for me.
Akira: One fugu.
Toshiro: Not fugu! If it is cut improperly it's... it's...
Akira: (DISMISSING) Yes, yes, it is poisonous, potentially fatal, but if sliced properly, it can be quite tasty.
Toshiro: (TO HIMSELF) I must get the Master.
Master: Oh, Miss Krabappel, your hair smells so clean.
Toshiro: Master, you are needed in the kitchen.
Master: I said cover for me, damn it!
Toshiro: But Master, we need your skilled hands.
Master: My skilled hands are busy. You do it!
Toshiro: Poison, poison, tasty fish.
Toshiro: (TO HIMSELF) Concentrate. Concentrate...
Homer Simpson: (YELLING) I want fugu!
Homer Simpson: Mmmm. Fan-fugu-tastic.
Homer Simpson: Beautiful language, isn't it, Marge?
Toshiro: For God's sake, don't eat another bite!
Homer Simpson: Oh, I couldn't possibly.
Toshiro: Mr. Simpson-san. I shall be blunt. We have reason to believe you have eaten poison.
Homer Simpson: Poison! What should I do? What should I do? Tell me quick!
Toshiro: Oh, no need to panic. There's a map to the hospital on the back of the menu.
(Hospital: ext. hospital - establishing)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF, MIMICKING) "Try something new, Homer. What'll it hurt you, Homer?" (THEN) I never heard of a poison pork chop.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hmmm, your wife agreed that I should break this to you.
Homer Simpson: No need, Doc. I can read Marge like a book.
Homer Simpson: (BRIGHTLY) Oooh! It's good news, isn't it?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: No, Mr. Simpson. If in fact, you've consumed the venom of the blowfish -- and from what the chef has told me, it's quite probable, you have twenty-four hours to live.
Homer Simpson: (UPSET) Twenty-four hours?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, twenty-two. I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Homer Simpson: (BREAKING DOWN) Oh Marge, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, if there's one consolation it's that you will feel no pain at all until some time tomorrow evening when your heart suddenly explodes.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Now, a little death anxiety is normal. You can expect to go through five stages. The first is denial.
Homer Simpson: No way! Because I'm not dying.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: The second is anger.
Homer Simpson: (GROWING ANGRY) Why you little --
Dr. Julius Hibbert: And after that comes fear.
Homer Simpson: (FEARFULLY) What's after fear? What's after fear?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Bargaining.
Homer Simpson: Doc, you gotta get me out of this. I'll make it worth your while.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Finally, acceptance.
Homer Simpson: Well, we all gotta go some time.
Homer Simpson: Told ya. Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave.

Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, Homer. Have you thought about what you want to tell the kids?
Homer Simpson: Nothing. It'll just upset them. I want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS IN AGREEMENT) Well, have you decided what you want to do tomorrow?
Homer Simpson: Almost.
Homer Simpson: I'm not done yet, Marge. What's that word you use for when you and I... you know...
Marge Simpson: When we're intimate?
Homer Simpson: (WRITING) Be intimate with Marge.

Bart Simpson: (RAPID FIRE PROTEST) Oh, come on, I do plenty around here! Lisa never lifts a finger. Why don't you go yell at her?
Homer Simpson: Shut up! Bart, this is good stuff. I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one, "cover for me." Number two, "oh, good idea, boss." Number three, "it was like that when I got here."
Bart Simpson: Hey, this is good stuff.
Homer Simpson: ...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.

Announcer #2: Yeah, it is far from over, but uh his approach has been wrong from the beginning as far as I'm concerned.
Announcer: Well, he's an erratic bowler, Chad. He tends to explode in the seven eight nine frame... Though I remember... in Boline, Illinois.
Announcer #2: Actually that, actually that was Pontiac, Michigan.
Announcer: Oh, thirty-eight pins going into the...
Announcer #2: Well he's stepping up now and he needs to get at least a spare...

Bart Simpson: Oh, it will not.
Homer Simpson: Oh yes it will.
Bald One: Our next movie is "McBane." Another shoot 'em up, push 'em through the plate-glass window, splatter-fest from the Hollywood cookie-cutter. Here's a typically brainless scene.
(Police Captain's Office: int. police captain's office)

Fat One: You know, I can't believe we're talking about the same movie!
Bald One: Oh, no...
Fat One: I thought "McBane" was a non-stop, roller-coaster of chills, thrills, spills and kills.
Bald One: (GROAN)
Fat One: And that chase at the end my friend... (KISSING NOISE)
Bald One: Are you nuts? That movie stinks like a creepy one bedroom apartment.
Fat One: Your mother didn't think it was so creepy.
Bald One: My mother. Real mature. I'm sick of your...
Homer Simpson: I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
Bart Simpson: Hey, what gives?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, do something!
Homer Simpson: All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery.
Bart Simpson: Looks like you lost the patient, Doc.
Homer Simpson: Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?
Lisa Simpson: (ALARMED) No!
Homer Simpson: How's this?
Lisa Simpson: (SCREAM)
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY) Okay, just everybody remain calm.
Lisa Simpson: (ANGUISHED SCREAM)
Bart Simpson: Hey, everybody! If you look real close, you can kinda make 'em out.
Homer Simpson: Hey, yeah, yeah. I think I can.
Marge Simpson: I think this is sick. They're staring at a dot!
Homer Simpson: She's right! She's right!
Homer Simpson: (BREAKS DOWN, CRYING) Oh, how I miss TV! Dear, God. Just give me one channel!
Marge Simpson: Homer. It's not the end of the world. You know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television.
Bart Simpson: You lie!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: No, it's true, Bart. We used to shoot pool... and go dancing...
Lisa Simpson: How romantic.
Marge Simpson: And a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk, just like this.
Marge Simpson: Whoa--
Bart Simpson: I'm livin' it but I ain't lovin' it.
Lisa Simpson: It's so hard to picture you two then. Hand in hand at the crossroads of life. There are so many questions.

Marge Simpson: I'm for equal rights. But do we really need a whole amendment?
Kim: Come on, Marge. Don't you think you deserve to earn just as much as a man who does the same job?

Principal Dondelinger: Allow me, gentlemen. You just bought yourselves three days of detention. You know where and when.
Barney Gumble: (SADLY) Three o'clock. Old building. Room 106.
(Springfield High School: ext. springfield high school - front lawn)
Marge Simpson: ... And in another article, I found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife, who incidentally is not married to a house, would cost forty-eight thousand dollars a year!
Marge Simpson: The first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these... male imposed shackles.
Kim: I didn't think it would burn so fast.
Marge Simpson: Hm, I guess it's the tissue paper inside.
Principal Dondelinger: Miss Bouvier, I am surprised!

MCINTYRE: (CHUCKLES) That's not exactly the type of guidance I give.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Oh.
MCINTYRE: Well, I like to think I do something helpful for every student N through Z. The only advice I can give you is, try to share a common interest and spend, spend, spend.

Marge Simpson: (READING) "Myth: It's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies. Fact: Most movies shown on cable get two stars or less and are repeated ad nauseam." Hmm, well, I don't know.
Homer Simpson: Marge --
Homer Simpson: "Hear Me Roar -- The Network For Women."
Woman #1: (FROM TV) In the next half hour we'll show you how to cut your first aid bill in half by making your own bandaids.
Marge Simpson: Ooh. That's a good idea.
Woman #2: Now before we begin you'll need five yards of sterilized cotton...
Mexican Announcer: (THRU TV) El Mummeo le pone en el "Sleeper Hold". Donde esta los medicos de Mexico?
Homer Simpson: Oooo. Pro wrestling from Mexico. You know, down there it's a real sport.
Bart Simpson: Cool. This is where Jaws eats the boat.
Bart Simpson: Cool. This is where Die Hard jumps through the window.
Bart Simpson: Cool. This is where Wall Street gets arrested. (LAUGH)
Representative: (THRU TV; MATTER-OF-FACT) Mr. Speaker, if I could call your attention to the Retroactive Subsidy Appropriations Override Bill. I refer you to page four thousand five hundred and...
Homer Simpson: They must think people will watch anything.

Goliath: I don't know, Davey.
Marge Simpson: Aren't you ready for church, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Huh, wha'? Oh, okay.
(First Church of Springfield: int. church - day)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now today's Christian doesn't think he needs God. He thinks he's got it made. He's got his hi-fi... his boob tube... and his instant pizza pie...
Homer Simpson: (LICKING HIS CHOPS) Oooh. Pizza.
(Sunday School: int. sunday school - classroom - later)
Teacher: All right, children. Now, I don't want you to get frightened, but it's my responsibility to teach you this. Today's topic will be "hell".
Bart Simpson: All right. I've sat through mercy and I've sat through forgiveness. Finally, we get to the good stuff.
Teacher: Oh hell is a terrible place. Maggots are your sheet, worms your blanket. There's a lake of fire burning with sulfur, you'll be tormented day and night forever and ever. As a matter of fact, if you actually saw Hell, you'd be so frightened, you would die.
Bart Simpson: Oh, Miss Albright.
Teacher: Yes, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Are there pirates in hell?
Martin Prince: (RAISING HAND) So what you're saying is, there's a down side to the afterlife. How does one steer clear of this abode of the damned?
Teacher: By obeying the Ten Commandments.
Teacher: Ten simple rules that are easy to live by.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car)
Marge Simpson: So, what did you children learn about today?
Bart Simpson: Hell.
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Well, that's what we learned about. I sure as hell can't tell you we learned about hell unless I say hell, can I?
Homer Simpson: The lad has a point.
Bart Simpson: Hell, yes.
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: (SING-SONGY) Hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell.
Marge Simpson: Bart, you're no longer in Sunday School. Don't swear.

Lisa Simpson: (THUNDEROUSLY) Thou shalt not steal!
Clerk: Anything else?
Marge Simpson: Yes. I ate two grapes. Please charge me for them.
Clerk: Oh, two grapes? Who cares?
Marge Simpson: Just charge me something, please.
Clerk: Yeah, okay, all right. (INTO MIC) I need a price check on two grapes. Yeah, you heard me, Phil, two measly, stinking grapes.

Blockbuster Announcer: If you didn't catch it in the theater, or rent it, or see it someplace else, we've got it -- on the Blockbuster Channel!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Oh, great... (TO LISA) All right, what makes you say that?
Lisa Simpson: Well, at Sunday School we learned that stealing is a sin.
Homer Simpson: Well, duh.
Lisa Simpson: But everybody does it! I mean, we're stealing cable as we speak.
Homer Simpson: Oh. Hm, look at it this way. When you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?
Lisa Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: And did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?
Lisa Simpson: No, I didn't.
Homer Simpson: Well, run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the Feds.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I think that's pretty spurious.
Homer Simpson: Well, thank you honey.
Blockbuster Announcer: Friday night, live from Las Vegas. The ultimate match-up. The Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out.

Lenny Leonard: Hey, big fight comin' up.
Carl Carlson: Yeah, you want to come over to my house and listen to round-by-round updates on the radio?
Lenny Leonard: Oh yeah, okay. Oh, then after the fight, we can watch the still photos on the eleven o'clock news.
Carl Carlson: Not too shabby! Whadda you say, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (COYLY) We could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable TV.
Homer Simpson: Pass the pumice, please.
Waylon Smithers: Uh, he's Homer Simpson, sir. One of your drones from sector 7G.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. I'm so keen on seeing Watson vs. Tatum II, I'd even go to an employee's house. Oh, I can picture it now. The screen door rusting off its filthy hinges. Mangy dog staggering about looking vainly for a place to die.
Waylon Smithers: Permission to speak frankly, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Permission granted.
Waylon Smithers: Well, you are quite wealthy sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Thank you, Smithers. Your candor is most refreshing.
Waylon Smithers: No, no, I mean, why don't you pay for the fight yourself?
C. Montgomery Burns: Eh, Smithers, a big title fight is one of those rare occasions that I savor the sights, the sounds; and, (INHALES DEEPLY) ah yes, the smells of other men.
Waylon Smithers: You haven't lost the common touch, sir.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's bar - later that day)
Barney Gumble: So, Homer, I hear you got the fight.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, that's right. Eight o'clock, my place. Come one, come all.
Barney Gumble: Hey, Moe, how come you never got cable for the bar?
Moe Szyslak: Well, it was either cable or the mechanical bull.
Moe Szyslak: I made my choice and I stand by it.

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Thank you, but this store is open twenty-four hours. It puts great demands on my time.
Homer Simpson: Oh, too bad. It's gonna be a great fight.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh, the fight. Why didn't you say something? I'll get my brother, Sanjay, to cover for me. He deplores violence of all kinds.
(First Church of Springfield: ext. church - establishing)
Lisa Simpson: So, even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family, that would be stealing?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: No. Well, it is if he puts anything on it. Jelly, for example.
Lisa Simpson: (SOLEMNLY) I see.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (BEAT) Come on, Lisa, now you're here for a reason. (QUIETLY) Is your father stealing bread?
Lisa Simpson: Maybe. I don't watch him every minute. But what I am sure of is, we're getting cable for free.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, I'm afraid that is stealing, Lisa, and I think you must do something... hmmm.
Lisa Simpson: Should I have my father arrested?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, Lisa, on the surface, that would appear to be an ideal solution to the problem. But remember the Fourth Commandment, "Honor thy father and thy mother." Hmmm, Lisa, I would like to see you set an example by not watching the offending technology yourself?
Lisa Simpson: Thank you, Reverend Lovejoy.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - day)
Top Hat Announcer: (BREATHLESS FEMALE VOICE) You're watching Top Hat Entertainment. Adult programming all day, every day, except in Florida and Utah. Coming up next, "Stardust Memories."
Bart Simpson: (WIDE-EYED) Aye Carumba!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Dad!
Bart Simpson: Oh, here's what I was looking for.
Stock Reporter: Blue chips closed up three and three quarters... Oil service stocks slumped slightly on news of OPEC's continuing stalemate at their meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.
Homer Simpson: Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. It's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. I want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again.
Bart Simpson: Okay.
Homer Simpson: Promise me.
Bart Simpson: I promise I will never watch that channel again.
Homer Simpson: Good boy.
Lisa Simpson: Hi, Dad. I think stealing cable is wrong. So I'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example. It's the last you'll hear from me on the matter. Thank you for your time.
Homer Simpson: Hey Lisa -- (CHANGING CHANNELS) Racing from Belmont? Horsies!
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven.
Homer Simpson: There is something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like... well, not like Bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium.
Marge Simpson: Well, you know, Bart was looking at that racy movie today, and Lisa's losing a little respect for you... Maybe we should think about unhooking the cable.
Homer Simpson: Unhook it?! But I love cable.
Marge Simpson: Well, then maybe you should pay for it.
Homer Simpson: Look, look, Marge. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't, so I'm not going to.
Marge Simpson: But Homer, I'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I never put my foot down about anything.
Marge Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: ...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I'm sorry, I think it's coming down.
Marge Simpson: No, Homer, not over this. No, no.
Homer Simpson: It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge. It's coming down. The cable stays. The foot has spoken.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: (YAWNS) Seen it. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it. Ugh! Soccer. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it.
Cable Guy: Hey, Simpson!
Homer Simpson: Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here?
Cable Guy: Well, your door wasn't locked in any serious way. I wonder if you'd be interested in this car stereo? A five hundred dollar value, but I'll let you have it for forty bucks.
Homer Simpson: Get out of my house! I don't wanna associate with criminals.
Cable Guy: Well, maybe I'll go see your neighbor.
Homer Simpson: He's not home.
Cable Guy: Even better.
Marge Simpson: Are you sure you want to do this, Homer? It doesn't look friendly.
Homer Simpson: Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff.
Bart Simpson: Come one, come all, Top Hat Theatre is on the air. The most beautiful women in the world. Just fifty-cents. I am your host, Bart Simpson. You must be at least eight years old to enter.
Bart Simpson: Well, back to the fight.
Top Hat Announcer: And now, the Top Hat Channel is honored to present, "Broadcast Nudes."
Milhouse Van Houten: Gross!
Martin Prince: Yet strangely compelling.
Milhouse Van Houten: It's a raid!
Homer Simpson: (SPUTTERING) Huh? What the? I know you -- come back here...
Homer Simpson: Bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! Now go to your room.
Bart Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Man, I wish I was an adult so I could break the rules.
Homer Simpson: Oh great.
Barney Gumble: Here, I brought some imported generic beer.
Marge Simpson: Thank you, Barney. (TO HOMER) How many people are coming, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Just a select circle of my friends.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh Hello, Mrs. Homer. I have brought an assortment of jerkies.
Homer Simpson: Oh, didja swipe those from work?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (OFFENDED) Certainly not. What has been implied here?
Boxing Announcer #1: Oh, no sir, there is no love lost between these two warriors. In fact, we almost had a scuffle earlier today, at the weigh-in.
Boxing Announcer #2: (TO FIGHTER #1) I understand you have a special motivation going into this bout.
Champ: Yeah, I want to dedicate this fight to my manager Vinnie, who got me here, and then (CHOKING UP) passed away just two weeks ago.
Boxing Announcer #2: Any response to that?
Challenger: Yeth, I would also like to dedicate thIS fight to the memory of his deceased manager.
Champ: You can't do that!
Challenger: I can do whatever I want!
Champ: You dedicate the fight to your manager, man!
Lisa Simpson: I just want to call attention to the fact that I'm not watching this fight. It's my form of non-violent protest.
Moe Szyslak: Hey, Homer, I brought ya...
Homer Simpson: Quick, it's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs...
Barney Gumble: Hey!
Homer Simpson: All right, will you... Hey, go protest outside will ya, now!.
Moe Szyslak: Hey, Homer. I brought you a mug.
Homer Simpson: (OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC) Oooh, thank you, Moe! I always wanted one of these.
Homer Simpson: Mr. Burns! Bart... quick. Hide the stuff I "borrowed" from work.
Homer Simpson: All right, the stuff I stole from work!
Bart Simpson: Oh, okay.
Homer Simpson: Now, c'mon. Take all this, and this, put it in the closet.
Homer Simpson: (TO LISA) Will you quit staring at me like that!
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, hello, Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: We were just in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by.
Homer Simpson: (STEPPING IN) Ugh, ah, hello, Mr. Burns. Would you like to watch the fight?
C. Montgomery Burns: The fight? Don't mind if I do. Oh, Simpson. Good news -- I brought some munchies. Smithers -- the Cheetos.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
Eddie: Are you Homer Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Yeah.
Lou: Word on the street is that you have an illegal cable hook-up.
Homer Simpson: (SPUTTERING) No... No I... It wasn't me... It was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... I would never...
Eddie: Hey, hey, settle down big fella.
Lou: We were, whoa, we were just wondering if we could watch the fight?
Homer Simpson: Oh, sure, sure. Be my guest.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, I brought you some lemonade for your protest.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks, Mom. It doesn't seem to be going very well.
Marge Simpson: Well, don't give up. When you love somebody you have to have faith that in the end they will do the right thing.
Boxing Announcer #2: The Challenger learned how to fight in the notorious projects of Capital City and honed his skills while serving time for aggravated assault and manslaughter in Springfield Prison.
Barney Gumble: All right, a local boy!
Challenger: For five years I was, I was incarcerated, away from my family and the mothers of my children. The conditions were irrevocable.
Homer Simpson: Oh, no.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMING) Marge, Lisa, Maggie...
Referee: Shake hands. Keep it clean.
Homer Simpson: (PANICKED) Come on, boy.
Homer Simpson: Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know I've made a couple of really important decisions. Number one: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. And Number Two: I'm not very fond of any of you.
Ranger Ned: (HORRIBLE SCREAMS)
Lisa Simpson: (HAPPILY) Dad, we may have saved your soul.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Yeah, at the worst possible time.
All: Eight... nine... ten... (YELLING)
Boxing Announcer #1: This fight is history! Stick a fork in it, it's done. A stunning knockout by a thunderous bolo punch in the closing seconds of the twelfth round, and Drederick Tatum is the new Champion of the World!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Everyone to my place for blueberry Squishees and microwave burritos!
Homer Simpson: The greatest fight ever and I missed it.
Lisa Simpson: We're really proud of you, Dad.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (TO BURNS) What a donnybrook game, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, hogwash! Why, I once watched Gentleman Jim Corbett fight an Eskimo fellow bare-knuckled for a hundred and thirteen rounds. Back then, of course, if a fight lasted less than fifty rounds, we demanded our nickel back.
Homer Simpson: Cable clippers, please.
Marge Simpson: Here you go, Homie.
Lisa Simpson: Go for it Dad!
Bart Simpson: Dad, I beg you to reconsider. Tractor pulls, Atlanta Braves baseball, Joe Franklin...
Homer Simpson: Oops.
Homer Simpson: Third time's the charm.

Marge Simpson: Homer, remember you promised you'd try to limit pork to six servings a week?
Seymour Skinner: (HOPEFUL) See me again tomorrow?
Homer Simpson: Marge, I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll unload the kids on Patty and Selma Saturday night. And then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. Just like old times.
Marge Simpson: (CROSSING TO THE PHONE) Saturday night? I'm not even sure my sisters will be available.

Seymour Skinner: Then the day after that.
Lisa Simpson: Poor Brandy. Aunt Selma, do you think you'll ever get married?
Selma Bouvier: Oh, I don't know. Why? You know somebody?
Lisa Simpson: No. And, since I'm sure that you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece, I'll simply hope that you're one of the statistically insignificant forty-year-old single women who ever find their fair Prince.
Marge Simpson: Patty! Selma! We're home.
Homer Simpson: I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me.
Selma Bouvier: Marge, I need to speak with you alone.
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! (OFF SNORING) No Barney, that's just my sister-in-law.

Marge Simpson: Well... I'll try.
Marge Simpson: Homer? Do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the Bowler's Hall of Fame in St. Louis, Missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin?
Homer Simpson: (FONDLY) Remember? Who could forget?
Marge Simpson: Then you'll also remember that you owe me a favor...

Homer Simpson: But that was just an idle promise.
Marge Simpson: Not to me.
Homer Simpson: (GROAN)
Marge Simpson: I want you to find a husband for my sister Selma.
Homer Simpson: Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?
Marge Simpson: She's the one who likes Police Academy movies and Hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched.
Marge Simpson: It's Patty who chose the life of celibacy. Selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her.
Homer Simpson: (WHINING) But Marge...
Marge Simpson: Homer, you will find her a man.
Homer Simpson: All right.
Marge Simpson: And not just any man.

Homer Simpson: (WEARILY) What is it this time?
Seymour Skinner: I'm afraid this time the victims are the innocent blades of grass on Groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field. If it's all right with you, Bart will repay his debt to society through back-breaking physical labor, re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed.
Homer Simpson: But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skinner, are you married?
Seymour Skinner: Only to my job.
Homer Simpson: But if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLING) Well, of course. These pants come off at night just like everyone else's. But tell me, why all the questions?
Homer Simpson: (COVERING) Oh, no reason, really. I was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. A payback for all the crummy things Bart has done to your school.

Seymour Skinner: (DREAMILY) Marvelous. Just marvelous.
Marge Simpson: (PROMPTING) Well, Selma hated Egypt, too. A camel spit on her.
Seymour Skinner: (NOT CARING) Oh, yes. I've heard they can be difficult. Patty, the Parents Advisory Board has asked that I attend the premiere of Space Mutants Part 5 tomorrow night. Would you be interested in joining me?
Patty Bouvier: (LOOKING AT SELMA) Well... I don't really think...

Seymour Skinner: (DETERMINED) The day after that, then.
Patty Bouvier: Seymour... you're touching me.
Seymour Skinner: (PASSIONATELY, MOVING CLOSER) Kiss me, Patty. I don't have cooties.

Executive #1: She was the Greek Goddess of Spring and rebirth.
HERB: (GROANS)
Executive #2: And get this, sir. She was carried off to Hades by the King of the Underworld. While there, she ate six pomegranates...
HERB: People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads. They want names like "Mustang" and "Cheetah" -- vicious animal names. The problem with you guys is you've forgotten your roots. (TO EXECUTIVE #2) You, what are your roots?
Executive #2: Well, I guess you could say they extend to when the Angles met the Saxons.

Homer Simpson: Oh, okay. I'd like a big one, then.
Otto Mann: Dook on!
Homer Simpson: Why not?
Executive #3: Because Americans don't want big cars.
Homer Simpson: Well, then give me one with lots of pep.
Executive #2: Sorry, our cars don't have pep.
HERB: Why not?
Executive #3: Because Americans want good mileage, not pep.
HERB: (TO HOMER) Homer, tell the nice man what country you come from.
Homer Simpson: America.
HERB: Do you hear that, you morons? This is why we're getting killed in the marketplace! Instead of listening to what people want, you're telling 'em what they want. Homer, I need your help.

Homer Simpson: What's that?
Head Engineer: The on-board computer.
Homer Simpson: All right. Wooo, what's that doohickey?
Head Engineer: Mr. Simpson, your brother told you to help us with this car now, didn't he?
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah, he did!
Head Engineer: (VERY CONDESCENDING) Hmmm hmmm, then why don't you get us some coffee.
Homer Simpson: (SADLY) Oh, okay.
Bart Simpson: Batting nine. Unky, Herbbbb!
Homer Simpson: Ugh, oh boy.
HERB: Hey Homer, how's your car coming?
Homer Simpson: Oh fine. We're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...
HERB: Homer...
Homer Simpson: Huh?
HERB: You didn't ask for rack and pinion steering, did you?
Homer Simpson: Uh, yeah, I think I did.
HERB: How could you ask for it? You don't even know what it is! You just called it rack and peanut steering.
Homer Simpson: Uh, may I be excused, please?
HERB: No! Homer, do you know why I gave you this job?
Homer Simpson: Because you think I'm a genius?
HERB: Nah, I don't think you're a genius.
Homer Simpson: Because you think I'm dynamic?
HERB: I don't think you're dynamic.
Homer Simpson: You think I work well with others?
HERB: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Homer, I gave you this job because you're an average schmoo.
Homer Simpson: (DEJECTED) Oh, great.
HERB: All you need is a little self-confidence.
Homer Simpson: (PLEADING) Ah, Unky Herb, I don't know anything about cars.
Head Engineer: Can do, Mr. S.
(Powell Motors Corporate Headquarters: ext. powell motors - day)
Bart Simpson: Bye, Unky Herb.
HERB: Up...up...up. Listen to me, here's what you do. From now on, before you say anything, say to yourself, "If I was ever sure of anything, I'm sure of this." Do you understand?
Homer Simpson: (MEEKLY) Sort of.
HERB: Homer!
Homer Simpson: What?
HERB: Answer me again with self-confidence.
Homer Simpson: (BELLOWING) Sort of!
HERB: Now go get 'em. (SHOUTS)
Homer Simpson: All right you eggheads! I want a place in this car to put my drink!
Head Engineer: Sir, the car has a beverage holder.
Homer Simpson: Hel-lo? Hel-lo Einstein? I said a place to put my drink. You know those Super Slakers they sell at the Kwik-E-Mart? (MAKING A BIG CIRCLE WITH HANDS) The cup is this big!
Head Engineer: (COWED) Extremely large beverage holder.
Homer Simpson: And I'm not done yet. You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car.
Head Engineer: (WRITING) Little... ball.
Homer Simpson: And some things are so snazzy they never go out of style! Like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!
Head Engineer: Bubble domes.

Lisa Simpson: What is it Unky Herb?
HERB: I want you to hear what the guys down at the plant think of your old man.
HERB: Y'ello.

Homer Simpson: I want a horn here, here and here. You can never find a horn when you're mad. And they should all play "La Cucaracha."
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM)
Homer Simpson: And sometimes, the kids are in the back seat, they're hollering, they're making you nuts. There's got to be something you can do about that.
Head Engineer: Maybe a built-in video game would keep them entertained?
Homer Simpson: You're fired! What is my brother paying you for?
Engineer #3: (TREMBLING) What about a separate sound proof bubble dome for the kids? With optional restraints and nuzzles.
Homer Simpson: Bullseye! And another thing. When I gun the motor, I want people to think the world is coming to an end! VROOM! VROOM! VROOM!

HERB: Oh good, good, good, good.

Homer Simpson: Powerful, like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding, like a Nerf ball. Now, at last, I have found it.

HERB: (TO HIMSELF) Ew.
HERB: Any questions?
Reporter: What does this monstrosity cost?
HERB: Uh, Jerry, what's the sticker price?
HERB: Eighty-two-thousand dollars! This monstrosity costs eighty-two-thousand dollars? What have I done! I mean the zoo was fun, but I'm ruined.
Lisa Simpson: Bye, Unky Herb.
Marge Simpson: Bye, Herb.
Homer Simpson: Gee, Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all your possessions. I can't help but think that maybe you would have been better off if I'd never come into your life.
HERB: Maybe I would have been better off?! Maybe? Why, you spongehead, of course I'd have been better off! As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother.
Homer Simpson: Ooo.

Marge Simpson: Time to get up, Lisa. (HAPPILY) It's a school day!
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, Lisa, you don't look well.
Lisa Simpson: I'll make it, Mom. Just tape my lunch box to my hand.

Dr. Julius Hibbert: (INTO PHONE) Uh, not that I'm angry, but how did you get my home number? (CHUCKLES) I see, quite ingenious.
Marge Simpson: Doctor, I think Lisa has the mumps.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (CHUCKLES) Well, Mrs. Simpson, much as I'd like to rely on your diagnosis, I think it might be professionally derelict of me to do so. Let me check my schedule.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Mm hm. Two o'clock is fine. Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.
Bart Simpson: No way! She's faking! If Lisa stays home, I stay home.
Lisa Simpson: If Bart stays home, I'm going to school.
Bart Simpson: Fine. Then... (TOTAL CONFUSION)
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Wait a minute. If Lisa goes to school then I go to school, but then Lisa stays home so I stay home, so Lisa goes to school...

Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh, are you? Well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard.
Sylvia Winfield: (INTO PHONE) There's only one family on this block... no, on earth... inconsiderate enough to let a monster like that roam free.
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? I am going to explain this to you one more time, and then I am going to hang up on you. (AS IF TO A VERY DIM-WITTED CHILD) It is not my dog. I tied my dog outside myself. I am looking at him right -- (ANNOYED GRUNT)

Emily: (TO CLASS) Ladies and gentlemen...
Emily: Most of you already know that, with a little (SACCHARINE) love and compassion, any puppy will grow up to be a cuddly little bundle of joy. Stuff and nonsense, taught by charlatans and learned by bloody twits. Let me tell you the two most important words you will ever hear in your life: choke chain.
Emily: You raise a dog the same way you would raise a child: with simple, authoritative commands... Lay down!
Emily: ...followed by immediate correction...
Martin Prince: How can we tell if we're doing this maneuver effectively?
Emily: The dog's eyes will cross and his tongue will protrude and change color ever so slightly.
Bart Simpson: Is my dog dead, ma'am?
Emily: (LAUGHING) You don't know how often I'm asked that. "Choke chain" is a misnomer. Trust me, they are always breathing.

(CANINE COLLEGE: EXT. CANINE COLLEGE - ESTABLISHING - DAY)

Lisa Simpson: Look, Mom, I finished my patch. It depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life.
Bart Simpson: Miss Winthrop, I was thinking...
Lisa Simpson: (COUGHS) On the left is Mr. Largo, my music teacher at school. He taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul. And on the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy. He taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth, so you better stick an instrument in front of it.
Marge Simpson: Hm.
Lisa Simpson: And look!
Marge Simpson: (PROUDLY) Come on, Homer. I want you to see what your sick little girl did.

Marge Simpson: MY QUILT! Six generations, gone. (CRIES)
Homer Simpson: (CALMLY) Now Marge, honey, honey, honey. Come on. Come on, don't get upset. It's not the end of the world. We all loved that quilt, but you can't get too attached to...

Homer Simpson: We never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.
Marge Simpson: Homer, what are you saying?

Bart Simpson: No way! You can't give my dog away! I'll set fire to my hair! I'll rip up all my clothes! I'll put sugar in the gas tank!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Lisa Simpson: I've suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog. But when I look into his vacant brown eyes, I just can't bear to let him go. I'm sure Mom agrees with me.
Marge Simpson: No, I'm afraid I agree with your father.
Homer Simpson: You do? (TAUNTING) Ha ha, ha ha ha!
Marge Simpson: Homer, please. It's not just the quilt. He's a nice dog, but he chews up everything. He doesn't obey. He's not even housebroken. And we've spent all this money on an obedience school and I don't see any improvement.
Bart Simpson: All right, all right. If Santa's Little Helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog, can we keep him then?
Homer Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: Dad!
Emily: Tch, tch. Oh, dear.
Bart Simpson: ...since you get paid either way, would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, this is our pet. We can question his integrity and disposition, but we can't question his heart. Are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away?
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING) Oh Lisa, if they're ever going to pull the plug on me, I want you in my corner, honey.
Marge Simpson: Oh, all right. If he passes obedience school, we can keep him.
Lisa Simpson: Yea!

Homer Simpson: Stop it, both of you. Grampa smells like a regular old man, which is more like a hallway in a hospital.
Marge Simpson: Homer, that's terrible. We should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly. You know, we'll be old someday.
Homer Simpson: My God, you're right, Marge. You kids wouldn't put me in a home like I did to my dad, would you?
Bart Simpson: Well...
Homer Simpson: (SCREAM) Marge, what do we do?

Grampa Simpson: We'll I'm Abraham J. Simpson. Care to tip the wrist with me?
BEA: I would be delighted.
BEA: So, tell me about yourself.
Grampa Simpson: Eh, widower, one son, one working kidney. And you?

Grampa Simpson: You left something out. Ravishing!
Grampa Simpson: And, what are you eh, doing tonight?

Grampa Simpson: (Disappointed) Oh. Well, if you've got plans already...
BEA: No, what were you going to say?
Grampa Simpson: Ah, nothin'.
BEA: Oh, Abe, you were going to say something.
Grampa Simpson: (AWKWARDLY) Well, I was wondering if you and I, you know, might go to the same place at the same time and ... Geez, you'd think this would get easier with time.
BEA: I'd love to.
Grampa Simpson: Okay, now, where's that pomade?

Herman Hermann: (INTERRUPTING) Ah, Grampa, nothing says "I love you" better than a military antique.
Herman Hermann: Let's take a look at the bayonet case. Huh?
Grampa Simpson: Hey, what's that?
Herman Hermann: That, my friend, was Napoleon's hat.
Grampa Simpson: It doesn't look like Napoleon's hat.
Herman Hermann: Well, it's not the famous hat. It's the one he wore for a week in April, 1796, just before he defeated the Sardinians.
Grampa Simpson: Ooh. How much?
Herman Hermann: Four hundred dollars.
Grampa Simpson: I'll give you five bucks.
Herman Hermann: That's not the kind of offer you should make to a man with a Gattling gun under the counter. Why don't you try Grandma's World.

Grampa Simpson: Ohhhhh, noooo.
Jasper Beardly: It was her ticker. The Doc said her left ventricle burst.

Grampa Simpson: A hundred and six thousand dollars?
Lionel Hutz: Ta-ta, Mr. Simpson. By the way, old timer, I do wills. Why don't I just give you this pen with my phone number on it. It looks just like a cigar! Isn't that something!

Lisa Simpson: Grampa, that's the noblest thought that's ever been expressed at this table.
Bart Simpson: Give it to us, Grampa.

C. Montgomery Burns: You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, old man.
Moe Szyslak: Here's the deal, Grampa. A guy, I think was an explorer, left this in the bar one night. It may be a map to ancient treasure, or directions to some guy's house, but to find out, we'll need money, we'll need provisions, and a two man diving bell.

Professor Jonathan Frink: You know, my wife will be happy. She's hated this whole death ray thing from day one.
Grampa Simpson: (WEARILY) Oh Lisa. What makes you think you deserve all that money?
Lisa Simpson: I don't deserve it, Grampa. No one here does. The people who deserve it are on the streets and they're in the slums. They're little children who need more library books and families who can't make ends meet. Of course, if you really wanted to, you could buy me a pony.
Grampa Simpson: You're right.
Lisa Simpson: I'll name her Princess and I'll ride her every day.

Grampa Simpson: No, I'll have you know, I've decided to give my money away to truly needy causes. But a hundred thousand dollars just isn't enough. I need more.

Grampa Simpson: Sorry, boy, I have to get enough to help everybody.
Homer Simpson: But you could lose everything. Come on.
Grampa Simpson: Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: "If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss and lose, and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss... Yours is the earth and everything that's in it. And -- which is more -- you'll be a man, my son."

Lisa Simpson: Mom...
(COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION: int. community college registration - a few moments later)
Professor Lombardo: Very good... Fabulous... Ooh, even better... You have real talent.
Marge Simpson: Do you really think so? My high school art teacher hated them.
Professor Lombardo: What? The man was a fool! But, still, one must admire the force of his conviction.
Marge Simpson: Then I'm in the class?
Professor Lombardo: Oh my dear, there couldn't be a class without you. Now if you'll excuse me, nature calls!
Professor Lombardo: Marvelous!
(Simpson Living Room: ext. simpson living room - day)
Bart Simpson: The Heavy Hands don't work unless you move, Homer.
Homer Simpson: I can't move, boy.
Bart Simpson: Oh really.
(Professor Lombardo's Class: int. professor lombardo's class - later that evening)
Professor Lombardo: Now, using the "Lombardo Method", you learn to see everyday objects as a simple grouping of geometrical shapes.
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, find me an artist.
(BROKERAGE: Int. brokerage - continuous)
Professor Lombardo: Here we see how two concentric circles, various trapezoids, ellipses and, yes, even a rhombus, can create an adorable little bunny rabbit!
Professor Lombardo: It's just that easy!
Marge Simpson: (CONFUSED MURMUR)
Lisa Simpson: Lincoln Lincoln I been thinkin' what the hell have you been drinkin'? / Is it water is it wine? / Oh my God it's turpentine! / Faster! Faster!
Homer Simpson: (GRUNTS REPEATEDLY)
(Community College Painting Studio: int. community college painting studio - night)
Professor Lombardo: (APPLAUDING) Bravo. (TO ANOTHER STUDENT) Walk away from it! Now it belongs to the ages. (TO ANOTHER STUDENT) You, not another stroke. Oh well, maybe one more. That's it! Perfect!
Professor Lombardo: Mmmm. Indeed. Marge, you find the inner beauty of your subject and bring it out for all to see.
Marge Simpson: Well, thank you, Professor Lombardo.
Professor Lombardo: Well, you're welcome, my dear! (LOW VOICE) Marge, walk with me.
Professor Lombardo: Marge, they've asked me to submit the best painting from my class to the Springfield Art Exhibition next week. I've decided to choose your "Bald Adonis"?
Marge Simpson: Really? You're so supportive. I wish every teacher was like you.
Professor Lombardo: Marge, please. I don't take praise very well.
Professor Lombardo: (TO JANITOR) Oh, another triumph!
(OLD ARMORY HALL: int. old armory hall - a week later)
Marge Simpson: I can't believe it.
BART & LISA: Yay, Mom!
Homer Simpson: Woo-ooo! I'm a work of art! "Last Supper", eat your heart out!
(Burns's Office: int. burns' office - the next day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Garbage! What matchbook art school did you flunk out of, you ham-fisted, nearsighted house painter? Smithers, throw this on the dung heap.
Artist: I'm sorry, but this isn't working out. I quit.
C. Montgomery Burns: (INNOCENTLY) Well, Smithers, I guess that's what you call your "artistic temperament".
Waylon Smithers: Sir, I must remind you that the dedication of the Burns Wing of the museum is only six days away.
C. Montgomery Burns: Damnation, Smithers! This idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait was as half-baked as your idea about me having children!
Marge Simpson: Okay, shoot.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, I'm afraid you've systematically alienated Springfield's entire art community. The only one left is this Mrs. Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONFUSED) Who?
Waylon Smithers: (LOOKING OVER THE ARTICLE) Well, she won first prize in the Springfield Art Fair, and as the wife of an employee, she'll be easily intimidated.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. Once again the wheel has turned and Dame Fortune has hugged Montgomery Burns to her sweet perfumed bosom. Somebody up there likes me, Smithers.
Waylon Smithers: Somebody down here likes you, too, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up.
Homer Simpson: Woo woo! Two forty nine! Yeah!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - morning)
Homer Simpson: Marge, Marge. Look at me! My clothes are just hanging off me!
Marge Simpson: Oh, that's wonderful, isn't it kids?
Lisa Simpson: Pass the moo juice.
Marge Simpson: Kids. Remember what I told you about showing a little support.
Lisa Simpson: Way to go, Dad.
Bart Simpson: You look mahvelous.
Homer Simpson: (TEARY) What a family.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. POWER PLANT - SNACK AREA - DAY)
Delivery Man: Hey, what gives? These donuts are pilin' up!
Carl Carlson: Yeah, Homer Simpson went on a diet.
Delivery Man: Oh my God! And I just bought a boat!
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, don't people answer the door these days?
Waylon Smithers: Allow me, sir.
Waylon Smithers: Open up!
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns. Would you like to come in?
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns would like to commission you to do a portrait of him. Have you ever painted the rich and powerful?
Marge Simpson: Well, no... just Ringo Starr.
C. Montgomery Burns: (WITH DIFFICULTY) Rin-go?
Waylon Smithers: He was the drummer for a rock 'n roll combo called the Beatles, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Beatles, eh? Oh, yes. I seem to remember their off-key caterwauling on the old Sullivan show. What was he thinking? (TO MARGE) Mrs. Simpson, this commission and all its glory can be yours, but first you must look me straight in the eye and answer one simple question.
C. Montgomery Burns: Can you make me beautiful?
Marge Simpson: I don't think that will be a problem.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm no matinee idol.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe not, but I have the gift of being able to see inner beauty.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmmm. (NODS) Mrs. Simpson, you may immortalize me.
Waylon Smithers: Ah, sir, at last the world will see you as I always have.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, yes, yes! Now don't be stingy with the blush, Smithers.
MR. BURNS' GEOMETRIC SHAPES: Now you! Paint!
Homer Simpson: Honey, I'm home!
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, there's an original sentiment.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
C. Montgomery Burns: Take it outside, Simpson. I'm male modeling.
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) I'm painting his portrait, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (FALSELY CHEERY) Oh, isn't that wonderful. My work and my home life come together in such a nice way. (LOW) Marge, may I see you in the other room?
Homer Simpson: Honey, he's nuts. He thinks he's handsome. Please, make him look handsome. Please, please, please, please...
Marge Simpson: Now, Homer, don't worry. All I need to do is find Mr. Burns' inner beauty.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
Marge Simpson: What were you like as a boy, Mr. Burns? Did you have a dog that you loved.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, aieeee! There's something on my leg! Get it off! Get it off!
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns, she's just a baby.
Homer Simpson: All right, all right, who took the funny pages?
Waylon Smithers: So, Ziggy goes to the repair shop and there's a sign on the doorbell reading "Out Of Order."
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLE) Ah, Ziggy... will you ever win?
Marge Simpson: Oh, my.
C. Montgomery Burns: (COVERING HIMSELF) If you'll excuse me, I'm changing for a board meeting.
Marge Simpson: (FLUSTERED) I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Mom. Did he have those spots all over his body?
C. Montgomery Burns: (STICKING HEAD OUT) I heard that.
Bart Simpson: Oops.
Waylon Smithers: Would you feel more comfortable if I left, too, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: Of course not, Smithers. You're like a doctor.
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, I want my tea!
Marge Simpson: Doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?
Waylon Smithers: (CHUCKLES) Actually, I value every second we're together -- from the moment I squeeze his orange juice in the morning, till I tuck him in at night. He's not just my boss, he's my best friend, too.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TASTING) Bah! Too hot!
Waylon Smithers: You're right, sir. It's scalding me as we speak.
(ENGLISH COUNTRY MANOR: ext. english country manor - day)
RINGO: (AS HE TYPES) Dear Sally. In response to your letter of December the twelfth 1966, me favorite color is blue and me real first name is Richard. Thanks for the snapshot. You're a real cute bird. Luv, Ringo. P.S. Forgive the lateness of my reply.
WETHERBY: Mr. Starr, tea and crumpets.
RINGO: (PREOCCUPIED) Just set it over there.
WETHERBY: Sir, if you'll forgive an old Brit his impertinence, your devotion to your fans is nothing short of remarkable.
RINGO: Well, Wetherby, they took the time to write me and I don't care if it takes me another twenty years... I'm going to answer every one of them.
RINGO: (RE: PACKAGE) Hello! What's this?
RINGO: From Springfield, U.S.A.
RINGO: (DELIGHTED) Gear!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Will you cease that infernal tootling!
Lisa Simpson: I was just practicing.
Marge Simpson: (THROUGH HER TEETH) Mr. Burns, it's hard to discover your inner beauty while you're shouting at an eight-year-old girl.
C. Montgomery Burns: We've only got two days left, so I'd advise you to shut up and paint!
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS ANGRILY)
Homer Simpson: All right, scale. You don't like me and I don't like you, but I've been very good, so you better treat me right.
Homer Simpson: All right! Woo woo! Woo woo!
Homer Simpson: Marge! I'm two-thirty-nine and I'm feeling fine! Look! I'm using the original notches that came with my belt.
Marge Simpson: That's wonderful Homer, I'm so proud of...
C. Montgomery Burns: Let me get this straight. You're pleased with your current appearance? (LAUGHS) Ah, why my good man, you're the fattest thing I've ever seen. And I've been on safari.
Homer Simpson: (SNIFFLING) If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator.
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns, I've had enough of your... posing. I can finish the portrait myself.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO SMITHERS) Thank goodness. Another day in this suburban nightmare and I would've needed half a white valium. (TO MARGE, CHEERY) Thank you for your gracious hospitality. See you at the unveiling.
Marge Simpson: Homer, what are you doing?!
Homer Simpson: No. Burns is right. What's the use?
Marge Simpson: Don't you listen to him. He's just a mean little S.O.B.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Marge.
Marge Simpson: I thought there was some good in everybody until I met him.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, well, just so long as you paint a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow.
Marge Simpson: I don't think I can.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) What?! Marge, you have to.
Marge Simpson: I can't make that man beautiful. I'm just not good enough. I guess I'm no artist.
Homer Simpson: Hello, what's this?
Homer Simpson: It's for you, Marge. From merry old England.
Marge Simpson: (EXCITED) From the desk of Ringo Starr!
RINGO: Dear Marge. Thanks for the fab painting of yours truly. I hung it on me wall. You're quite an artist. In answer to your question, yes, we do have hamburgers and fries in England, but we call french fries chips. Luv, Ringo. P.S. Forgive the lateness of my reply.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS DREAMILY)
Homer Simpson: Come on, Marge. Paint. I think you can do it.
Marge Simpson: (COYLY) Okay, Homer. If you think I can.
(SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM: ext. springfield art museum - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Friends, art lovers, security personnel. Today is a red letter day for the Springfield Palace of Fine Art. A new wing for our museum and a portrait commemorating the man who ponied up the dough.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ladies and gentlemen, may I invite you to behold... Montgomery Burns!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers!
Professor Lombardo: I don't care for this at all.
Kids: (LOUDER) Ewwwwww!
Martin Prince: Mrs. Krabappel, he's traumatizing the children.
Bart Simpson: More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos!
Marge Simpson: Umm... Hello. My name is Marge Simpson and I painted this. Maybe you'd like to know what possessed me to do it. Well, I guess I wanted to show that beneath Mr. Burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain, there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of God's creatures.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Provocative, but powerful.
MRS. HOOVER: He's bad, but he'll die. So I like it.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CALLING) Marge... a word, please.
C. Montgomery Burns: You know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate. And I don't hate this. Your painting is bold but beautiful. (CONFIDENTIALLY) And uh, incidentally, thanks for not making fun of my genitalia.
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) I thought I did.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. ELEMENTARY - LISA'S CLASSROOM - MORNING)
JANEY: Did you hear about Miss Hoover? She drank a bottle of drain cleaner by mistake.
Chuck: Uh, I heard she fell down a well.
Seymour Skinner: Come on now. Oh.
Lisa Simpson: My god, she's been dumped again.
Miss Hoover: Children, I won't be staying long. I just came from the doctor and I have Lyme disease. Principal Skinner will run the class until a substitute arrives.
Ralph Wiggum: (RAISING HAND) What's Lyme disease?
Seymour Skinner: Uh, I'll field that one. Lyme disease is spread by small parasites, called ticks. When a diseased tick attaches itself to you and begins sucking your blood,
Miss Hoover: (ANGUISHED SIGH)
Seymour Skinner: Malignant spirochetes infest your bloodstream, eventually spreading to your spinal fluid, and on into the brain.
Miss Hoover: The brain? Oh, dear God!
Seymour Skinner: Come on, Elizabeth. Come, come.
Seymour Skinner: (TOO FRIENDLY) Well now, children, here we are, open your primers to page 32.
Seymour Skinner: Ah, substraction.
Seymour Skinner: (ANGRY) Bart Simpson... I know it's you.
Bart Simpson: (MATTER OF FACT) And here comes Snowball II. This is the one we kept.
Kids: Ewwwwwww!
Bart Simpson: We were going to keep the gray one, but the mother ate her.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: As usual, I agree with you, Martin. Bart, shut that off and take your seat immediately.
Bart Simpson: (PICKING UP REMOTE CONTROL) Oh look, this is really cool. When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in.
Kids: (SCREAM)
Seymour Skinner: No children, your not seeing things, this, my little friends, is a schwa.
Seymour Skinner: Are you the substitute?
BERGSTROM: Yes, sir. Yes I am.
Seymour Skinner: Are you insane?
BERGSTROM: No, no sir. No, I'm not. It's my way of getting their attention.
Seymour Skinner: Well, all right. (TO KIDS, TOO FRIENDLY) Play friendly with your new teacher, children!
BERGSTROM: (TEXAS ACCENT) Howdy. I am a Texas cowboy. The year is 1830. You young'uns ask me any questions you like.
Chuck: (RAISING HAND) Can we play kickball instead of science after lunch?
BERGSTROM: Kickball? Son, there ain't no kickball in 1830. Any other questions?
BERGSTROM: Shoot! It's awfully quiet on the plains here. Well, how about this? Everybody, I want to see two eyes on every single person staring right at me, right now. There are three things wrong with my costume. Anybody names those three things will get my hat.
Lisa Simpson: (RAISING HAND) I believe I know the answer.
BERGSTROM: Well, well, wha... wha...what's your name?
Lisa Simpson: Lisa Simpson.
BERGSTROM: Well, go ahead, Miss Simpson.
Lisa Simpson: Um, one: Your belt buckle says "State of Texas", but Texas wasn't a state until 1845.
BERGSTROM: Very good.
Lisa Simpson: Two: the revolver wasn't invented until 1835.
BERGSTROM: That's excellent.
Lisa Simpson: Three: You seem to be of the Jewish faith.
BERGSTROM: Are you sure I'm Jewish?
Lisa Simpson: Or Italian?
BERGSTROM: I'm Jewish.
Lisa Simpson: And there weren't any Jewish cowboys.
Terri/sherri: Speech! Speech!
Bart Simpson: I had a speech ready... but my dog ate it!
Kids: (LAUGHING)
BERGSTROM: Very good! That's excellent! And I'm also wearing a digital watch, but I'll accept that. Here you go, little lady. And for the record there were a few Jewish cowboys, ladies and gentlemen. Big guys, who were great shots, and spent money freely. I'm Mr. Bergstrom. Feel free to make fun of my name if you want. Two suggestions are Mister Nerdstrom and Mister Boogerstrom.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Boys and girls, today we will begin selecting a class president.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I'm not allowed to vote, but I strongly suggest you elect Martin. Martin...
Martin Prince: As your president, I would demand a science fiction library featuring an A-B-C of the Overlords of the genre: Asimov, Master, Clarke...
Wendell Borton: (RAISING HAND) What about Ray Bradbury?
Martin Prince: (DISMISSING) I'm aware of his work. (TO CLASS) Thank you and (OMINOUSLY) keep watching the skies.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Excellent (APPLAUDING) Excellent, Martin.
BERGSTROM: If you're through with your pemmican, why don't we sing a song about cowboys? Now this one's not very accurate, but we can fix it up as we go along. Okay?
BERGSTROM: (SINGING) Home, home on the range. (SPEAKING QUICKLY) Actually, the range was far from home, it was a very desolate place where danger and disease rode tall in the saddle. (SINGING) Where the deer and the antelope play. (SPEAKING) Unlike the efficient Indians, cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope and they threw the rest away.
BERGSTROM: (SINGING) Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.
BERGSTROM: Hey, what's this? Did you do it?
Lisa Simpson: (NERVOUS) No! No! It wasn't me! I would never do anything like that. It was just one of those immature people who, instead of building themselves up --
BERGSTROM: It's neat. Can I have it? (TO CLASS)
Lisa Simpson: Yes, but I didn't do it.
BERGSTROM: Are you sure you didn't do it? It's good.
Lisa Simpson: No, but I'm starting to wish I had.
BERGSTROM: (CHUCKLES) Ladies and gentlemen, the Singing Dork!
Classmate: (WHISPERS) Lisa (CHUCKLES)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Any other nominations?
Terri/sherri: We nominate Bart Simpson!
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - continuous)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Children! (FRIENDLY) Bart, I need someone very reliable to deliver an important message to the principal's office.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Would you do it for me?
Bart Simpson: (PLAYING TO CROWD) Why, Mrs. Krabappel! How would I know where the principal's office is?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: People, what have I told you about encouraging him? When Bart wins approval for making a fool of himself, it makes him think that --
Milhouse Van Houten: (POINTING TO DOOR) Yay, Bart!
BERGSTROM: (READING IN A WHISPER) Nobody, of the hundreds of people that visited the fair, knew that a grey spider had played the most important part of all. No one was with her when she died."
BERGSTROM: Come on, Janey, everybody has a talent. I want to see yours, that's all.
JANEY: I don't have a talent.
BERGSTROM: You cannot talk like that. There has to be something that you can do better than anybody else.
JANEY: Well, I can do this --
BERGSTROM: Yes! Great! Ok, how about you, Ralph?
BERGSTROM: Wonderful! Chuck?
BERGSTROM: Oh, that's disgusting. I love it! Lisa... come on, you're holding out on us. I see a saxophone over there!
Lisa Simpson: I can't.
BERGSTROM: Come on, Lisa, I bet you're good.
Lisa Simpson: No, really, I can't.
BERGSTROM: Sure you can; just try.
Lisa Simpson: Please don't make me do it.
BERGSTROM: All right. You owe me something special.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: So while I'm technically still married, there really hasn't been any marriage to speak of since Mister Krabappel moved into his little "love nest."
BERGSTROM: This profession can put a lot of strain on a marriage.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (ENTICINGLY) Since he's been gone, I've been looking for a substitute to teach me a lesson I sorely need.
BERGSTROM: (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Mrs. Krabappel, you're trying to seduce me.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well...
BERGSTROM: I'm sorry, Mrs. Krabappel, you're very nice, but it's the children I love.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - THE NEXT MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: (DREAMILY) When I fall asleep, Mr. Bergstrom is the last thing I think of, and he's my first thought when I wake up.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, I feel that way about your father.
Lisa Simpson: No, no. You don't understand. (DREAMILY) When Mr. Bergstrom smiles, you only see these teeth --
Lisa Simpson: -- but when you really make him laugh, you can see these two teeth. I think they're called the eye teeth.
Lisa Simpson: I don't know if he had orthodontic work or what, but they're absolutely perfect.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, I notice little things about your father, too.
Lisa Simpson: No, Mom. This is different. I mean, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better.
Marge Simpson: (FIRMLY) Your father does that to me.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, are we gonna talk, or are we gonna talk?
Marge Simpson: (MEASURED ANGER) Lisa, we can talk, but first you have to accept the fact that I feel that way about your father!
Lisa Simpson: Fine.
Lisa Simpson: (TO MARGE) Yesterday, he read us "Charlotte's Web", and cried at the end, never trying to hide his tears.
Homer Simpson: A book made him cry! Boo hoo hoo!
Bart Simpson: (RUBBING EYES) Waaaaaaaah!
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. ELEMENTARY - LISA'S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON)
BERGSTROM: Remember, nobody, and I mean nobody gets back in after lunch without one igneous rock, that's volcanic, and one sedimentary, and that is layered. Lisa, can I see to you for a minute.
Lisa Simpson: (LOW) Yes! (LOUDER) Yes, Mr. Bergstrom?
BERGSTROM: Lisa, your homework is always so neat. How can I put this? Does your father help you with it?
Lisa Simpson: No. Homework's not my father's specialty.
BERGSTROM: Well, there's no shame in it. I mean my Dad could really --
Lisa Simpson: Not mine.
BERGSTROM: You didn't let me finish.
Lisa Simpson: Unless the next word was burp, you didn't have to.
(Elementary - Bart's Classroom: INT. ELEMENTARY - BART'S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON)
Martin Prince: In a sample taken in this very classroom, a state inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos --
Bart Simpson: That's not enough! We demand more asbestos! More Asbestos!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Homer Simpson: Wow! You made the front page.
Bart Simpson: (DISMISSING) Aw, Dad. It's just a popularity contest.
Homer Simpson: Just a popularity contest?! Excuse me, what's more important than popularity? Now, Bart, do you really think you can win?
Bart Simpson: Sure, why not?
Homer Simpson: Woo woo! All right! I always knew you had personality. The doctors said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better. (SAVORING) President Simpson. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?
Bart Simpson: (WARMING TO IT) Hm, yeah.
Homer Simpson: Now, go get 'em.
Bart Simpson: He says, there aren't any easy answers! I say, he's not looking hard enough!
Kids: Yay!
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. ELEMENTARY - LISA'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS)
Lisa Simpson: Oh, you'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator.
BERGSTROM: (POINTS TO BART) You're going to miss your brother's antics.
Lisa Simpson: When?
BERGSTROM: When? When your life takes you places the rest of us have only heard about.
Lisa Simpson: Places where my intelligence will be an asset, not a liability?
BERGSTROM: Yes, there is such a place, believe me. It's true.
Lisa Simpson: I believe everything you say, with your words, your body language and your Semitic good looks.
Ralph Wiggum: (READING) "Dear Miss Hoover: You have Lyme disease. We miss you. Kevin's biting me. Come back soon. Here is a drawing of a spirochete. Love, Ralph."
BERGSTROM: Oh, that's great, Ralph!
BERGSTROM: Hey, kids. I've learned that in two weeks the Springfield Museum of Natural History will be closing forever due to a lack of interest. I urge you to see it while you can.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVINGING ROOM - THAT NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and I think you should take her.
Homer Simpson: The Museum!
Marge Simpson: Hmmm huh.
Homer Simpson: Tomorrow... ugh; oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on... sleeping... eating a big sandwich... watching T.V... spending some time with the boy. Spending time with the boy. The boy needs attention, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Homer, I've been talking to Lisa and I'm concerned about your relationship with her.
Bart Simpson: (MOCK CONCERN) Me, too, Mom. I think they're drifting apart.
Homer Simpson: Shut up, boy.
Marge Simpson: Homer, please.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because... you're trapped. If you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! All right! I'll take her. (TO HIMSELF) Lousy brain.
(Museum: INT. MUSEUM - ADMISSION AREA - DAY)
Homer Simpson: Hey, what do you mean by, "Suggested Donation"?
Woman In Booth: Pay any amount you wish, sir.
Homer Simpson: And what if I "wish" to pay zero?
Woman In Booth: Then it's up to you.
Homer Simpson: Oooh, so it's up to me, is it?
Woman In Booth: Yes.
Homer Simpson: (CHORTLES) I see, and you think that people are gonna pay you four dollars and fifty cents, even though they don't have to, just out of the goodness of their... (SCORNFUL LAUGH) Well, anything you say! Good luck, lady! You're gonna need it!
Lisa Simpson: (DELIGHTED) Mr. Bergstrom!
BERGSTROM: Hi, Lisa.
Homer Simpson: Hey! You don't have to pay! Read the sign!
BERGSTROM: (TO LISA) And this must be your father.
BERGSTROM: His teeth had jagged edges to rip through your body, but he could've swallowed you whole!
Lisa Simpson: Wow!
BERGSTROM: Actually, Mr. Simpson, they do know a great deal about the process of mummification. First, they pulled the brain out through the nose with an iron hook, and stuffed the insides with sawdust and onions!
Lisa Simpson: Ewww. Gross.
Homer Simpson: Ohh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than of the Wolf Man.
Lisa Simpson: Oh Lord.
BERGSTROM: Mr. Simpson... I'm gonna be presumptuous. I have noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
Homer Simpson: She said that?
BERGSTROM: Well, no, she didn't say it, but, you know, she...
Homer Simpson: (SHAKY) But you can tell, right? She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, "Why me? What did I do to deserve this fat old piece of -- " (CRYING)
BERGSTROM: Mr. Simpson, you have got to be a bigger man. There is a wonderful girl's future at stake.
Homer Simpson: (SNAPPING OUT OF IT) Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A.
BERGSTROM: I am giving her an A.
Homer Simpson: Great. But don't tell her it was a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.
BERGSTROM: Mr. Simpson, she did earn it.
Homer Simpson: You are smooth. I'll give you that.
(SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRCASE: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: He ruined the one chance I had of getting to know Mr. Bergstrom outside of school.
Marge Simpson: Well... I'll tell you what. Why don't we invite Mr. Bergstrom to dinner?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, Mom, that's wonderful. Can I find out his favorite dish and help you make it!
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Lisa Simpson: Can I wear your jewelry?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Lisa Simpson: Can I get my ears pierced?
Marge Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Can I dye my shoes pink?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Lisa Simpson: Can I paint my nails?
Marge Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Can we have wine?

Miss Hoover: Good morning, Lisa.
Miss Hoover: (OFF LISA'S REACTION) I'm back.
Miss Hoover: You see, class, my Lyme disease turned out to be...
Miss Hoover: Psy-cho-so-ma-tic.
Ralph Wiggum: Does that mean you were crazy?
JANEY: No, that means she was faking it.
Miss Hoover: No, actually, it was a little of both. Sometimes when a disease is in all the magazines and all the news shows, it's only natural that you think you have it.
Lisa Simpson: (NEAR TEARS) Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
Miss Hoover: I don't know. Although I'd sure like to talk to him. He didn't touch my lesson plan. What did he teach you?
Lisa Simpson: That life is worth living.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: The polls will be open from now until the end of recess. Now, (SOUR) just in case any of you have decided to put any thought into this, we'll have our final statements. Martin?
Martin Prince: (HOARSE WHISPER) I don't think there's anything left to say.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Bart?
Bart Simpson: Victory party under the slide!
(Apartment Building: Ext. apartment building - day)
Lisa Simpson: (CALLING) Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom!
Landlady: Hey, hey, he Moved out this morning. He must have a new job -- he took his Copernicus costume.
Lisa Simpson: Do you know where I could find him?
Landlady: I think he's taking the next train to Capital City.
Lisa Simpson: The train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound.
Landlady: Yes, and it's been the backbone of our country since Leland Stanford drove that golden spike at Promontory point.
Lisa Simpson: I see he touched you, too.
(Springfield Elementary School: EXT. ELEMENTARY - SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON)
Bart Simpson: Hey, thanks for your vote, man.
Nelson Muntz: I didn't vote. Voting's for geeks.
Bart Simpson: Well, you got that right. (TO TERRI AND SHERRI) Thanks for your vote, girls.
Terri/sherri: We forgot.
Bart Simpson: Well, don't sweat it. Just so long as a couple of people did... right, Milhouse?
Milhouse Van Houten: Uh oh.
Bart Simpson: Lewis?
Bart Simpson: (LOUDER) Somebody must have voted.
Milhouse Van Houten: What about you, Bart? Didn't you vote?
Bart Simpson: Uh oh.
Bart Simpson: (ANGUISHED SCREAM)
Wendell Borton: Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - evening)
Bart Simpson: (TO MRS. KRABAPPEL) I demand a recount.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: One for Martin, two for Martin. Would you like another recount?
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) No.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (RELISHING IT) Well, I just want to make sure. One for Martin. Two for Martin.
Kid Reporter: (TO MARTIN) This way, Mister President!
(Train Station: int. train station - afternoon)
Conductor: Now boarding on track 5, The afternoon delight coming to Shelbyville, Parkville, and…..
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!
BERGSTROM: Hey, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: Hey, Lisa, indeed.
BERGSTROM: What? What is it?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?
BERGSTROM: Ah, I'm sorry, Lisa. You know, it's the life of the substitute teacher: he's a fraud. Today he might be wearing gym shorts, tomorrow he's speaking French, or, or, or pretending to know how to run a band saw, or God knows what.
Lisa Simpson: You can't go! You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
BERGSTROM: Ah, that's not true. Other teachers will come along who...
Lisa Simpson: Oh, please.
BERGSTROM: No, I can't lie to you, I am the best. But, you know, they need me over in the projects of Capital City.
Lisa Simpson: But I need you too.
BERGSTROM: That's the problem with being middle class. Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.
Lisa Simpson: (SNIFFLING) I, I understand. Mr. Bergstrom, I'm going to miss you.
BERGSTROM: I'll tell you what...
BERGSTROM: Whenever you feel like you're alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know.
Lisa Simpson: (CHOKED UP) Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom.
Conductor: All aboard!
Lisa Simpson: So, I guess this is it? It you don't mind I'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?
BERGSTROM: Goodbye, Lisa honey. It'll be okay. Just read the note.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - night)
Homer Simpson: (INDIGNANT) Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
Homer Simpson: (MULLING IT OVER, LOW, TO HIMSELF) Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. (TRYING TO CONVINCE HIMSELF) Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. (NOTICING LISA) What are you so mopey about?
Lisa Simpson: Nothing.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, tell your father.
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Bergstrom left today.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Lisa Simpson: He's gone. Forever.
Homer Simpson: And?
Lisa Simpson: I didn't think you'd understand.
Homer Simpson: Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
Lisa Simpson: (FIGHTING BACK TEARS) I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED) Me?
Lisa Simpson: Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!
Homer Simpson: I don't think you realize what you're saying.
Lisa Simpson: Baboon!
Bart Simpson: Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can't believe it was her.
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED) Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!
Marge Simpson: Homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There's a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy.
Homer Simpson: (READING THE SIGN) Go Away.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?
Lisa Simpson: No!
Homer Simpson: Nuts.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) This isn't going well at all.
Lisa Simpson: Look, if you just want me to forgive you --
Homer Simpson: No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say.
Homer Simpson: Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof.
Lisa Simpson: (MOANS)
Marge Simpson: That was our wedding.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Marge Simpson: (LOOKS UP) Children, it's time for you to go to bed.
Homer Simpson: (PATS HER HEAD) It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. (BEAT) Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah.
Homer Simpson: I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
Lisa Simpson: You're so silly.
Homer Simpson: Gimme a banana.
Lisa Simpson: I don't have any banana.
Homer Simpson: Come on, you're holding out on me.
Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Think nothing of it.
Homer Simpson: Hey, what's the matter, son?
Bart Simpson: (SHAKING HEAD) Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted...
Homer Simpson: Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Would you have to do extra work?
Bart Simpson: Yeah.
Homer Simpson: And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?
Bart Simpson: Well, no.
Homer Simpson: So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto.
Bart Simpson: (BRIGHTENING) Hey! Thanks, monkey-man.
Homer Simpson: Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
Homer Simpson: Uh oh.
Homer Simpson: Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three.
Marge Simpson: Homie, did you straighten everything out...?
Homer Simpson: (HAPPILY) Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - night)
Homer Simpson: Mmm... hors doovers.
Marge Simpson: Homer! You promised!
Homer Simpson: I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
Marge Simpson: Homer, please. We've never thrown a party. Now we're gonna pay back all the friends who've invited us to their homes.
Lisa Simpson: But Mom, I want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed.
Homer Simpson: (KNOWING CHUCKLE) Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better.
Homer Simpson: Hmmm. (SMACKS HIS LIPS) Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah.
Marge Simpson: (FLUSTERED) Oh! They're here! How does everything look?
Homer Simpson: How do I look?
Marge Simpson: Do we have enough glasses?
Homer Simpson: Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
Marge Simpson: Homer! Homer! Put a record on!
Homer Simpson: What are all our friends names again?
Marge Simpson: Children! Go!
Ned Flanders: Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology. (LAUGHS)
Moe Szyslak: (UNDER BREATH) College boy.
Ned Flanders: Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?
Homer Simpson: Why not? I paid for it.
Homer Simpson: Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?
Ned Flanders: Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor. (LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.
Marge Simpson: Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?
Homer Simpson: No.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson home - a little later)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson HOUSE - LIVING ROOM)
Barney Gumble: Hi! You're Homer's sister-in-law, right? I remember you, but I don't remember you being so beau (BURP) --tiful.
Barney Gumble: Ow! Hey! Jeez! (COUGHING, THEN BURP)
Barney Gumble: (MAKING CONVERSATION) Is that a new kind of Mace? (IMPRESSED) It's really painful.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Uh, no, not really. Someone seems to have slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink.
Homer Simpson: (EXPLODING, LAUGHING) It was me! You fell for it!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Homer, these novelty ice cubes are often made from highly toxic chemicals. Ironically, a real fly would have been much more sanitary.
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Homer Simpson: (OBLIVIOUS, LAUGHING) You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
Homer Simpson: Bart! Come over here.
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?
Bart Simpson: Yes sir.
Homer Simpson: Bart, do that thing you do that's so cute.
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: That thing you know how to do.
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: (LONG BEAT) Go to bed.
Homer Simpson: Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!
Barney Gumble: Oh, Homer, you're the king!
Homer Simpson: I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve.
Husband Of Marge's Friend: Homer, I don't know you. My wife and your wife are friends. We met just three hours ago.
Homer Simpson: (POWERFULLY) You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!
Husband Of Marge's Friend: (CONFUSED) Uh, gee Homer, don't quit...
Homer Simpson: All right then.
Homer Simpson: (HUSKILY) Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude?
Maude Flanders: Oh sure.
Homer Simpson: Not those peanuts. (HOARSELY) The ones at the bottom.
Homer Simpson: (SHUDDERS WITH ECSTASY)
Marge Simpson: (VERY ANNOYED MURMUR)
Barney Gumble: Hey, thanks for invitin' me. I had a wonderful time.
Marge Simpson: I must apologize for my husband.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you roll him onto his side.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm. thank you. I will, Dr. Hibbert. Thanks for coming.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Remember, I said if.
Marge Simpson: I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
Homer Simpson: (GROGGY) Why? What'd you do?
Homer Simpson: Marge!
Marge Simpson: Come here!
Homer Simpson: Where-where are we going?
Marge Simpson: Shhh.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - a little later)
Marge Simpson: I want to make sure the kids don't hear. When I was young, I always hated knowing my parents were fighting.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - foyer window - continuous)
Bart Simpson: They're fighting in the car again.
Lisa Simpson: That music always sends a chill down my spine.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?
Homer Simpson: The way I acted?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Homer Simpson: (CASUAL SOPHISTICATED WHIMSY) So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
Sophisticate #1: Good lord! There's a fly in my drink!
Homer Simpson: (SMILING) I put it there.
Sophisticate #1: (ASTONISHED) You did?
Homer Simpson: I slipped it into your glass as a gag.
Sophisticate #1: (ADMIRINGLY) Pure hilarity!
Sophisticate #2: Pure Homer!
Sophisticate #3: I pronounce it to be the most whimsical jape of the season!
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I like to think that I'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!
Homer Simpson: I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church.
Marge Simpson: I'm going to church alone today. You're going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life.
Homer Simpson: No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bart's room)
Homer Simpson: About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
Bart Simpson: I understand why. You were wasted.
Homer Simpson: I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
Bart Simpson: Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will.
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aw.
(First Church of Springfield: int. church - day)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now before I give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, I have some announcements to make. (LOOKS AT INDEX CARD) We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including "Bible Bafflers", "Satan's Boners," "Good Grief! More Satan's Boners" and, for the teens, "It's Not Cool To Fry In Hell."
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) Marge, Marge.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I'm sorry. The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking of Homer Simpson's shoes. Why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?
Homer Simpson: Sorry, Reverend.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Sit down, Homer.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (LOOKS AT ANOTHER CARD) Mrs. Lovejoy and myself will be holding our third annual marriage retreat next weekend at Catfish Lake. It's psychological counseling for couples whose marriages are hanging by a thread...
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: ... or those just in need of a tune-up.
Homer Simpson: Hmmmm.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now if you wish to participate, please sign up on your way out after the service is over.
(CHURCH FOYER: int. church foyer)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Will the Simpsons be attending our little retreat?
Homer Simpson: (FAKING ENTHUSIASM) Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea.
Homer Simpson: Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!
Marge Simpson: We'll be there!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(Simpson Home: int. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER bedroom - next saturday morning)
Homer Simpson: Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!
Bart Simpson: Now you wanna go?
Homer Simpson: (SLYLY) They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
Marge Simpson: We're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that's all. No fishing.
Marge Simpson: Oh, that must be the babysitter.
Marge Simpson: Hello. I'm Mrs. Simpson.
Sultan: (SOUNDS VAGUELY FAMILIAR) Simpson... Simpson...
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHING DEMONICALLY) Come back for more, eh?
Marge Simpson: Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
Homer Simpson: (FALSE DISMAY) Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth.
Bart Simpson: What do you need a babysitter for? I'm almost ten and a half.
Lisa Simpson: (PROTESTING) Mom! You wouldn't dare.
Bart Simpson: Don't take that tone with me, young lady, or I'll give you a taste of the back of me hand.
Homer Simpson: No, you don't!
Marge Simpson: Grampa?
Grampa Simpson: (STARTLED) Huh... who?... what?
Marge Simpson: Grampa, could you do something?
Grampa Simpson: I can dress myself.
Marge Simpson: Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate.
Grampa Simpson: Oh sure. Last resort... Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. (SIGHS) Everyone's agin me. I'll do it.
Homer Simpson: Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk.
Marge Simpson: Now, if Maggie runs a fever, you call this number. If she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. And if she drinks pine cleanser, call this...
Grampa Simpson: (GRABBING THE LIST) Just give me the list. I can read.
Marge Simpson: All right. All right. Goodbye, children. And behave yourselves.
Marge Simpson: (AN ASIDE) Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub.
Grampa Simpson: I heard that.
Bart Simpson: Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this. It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do.
Grampa Simpson: Uh huh .. (SCANS LIST) Uh-huh... (CONFUSED) You're allowed smoke cigars?
(Mountain Road: ext. mountain road - a half hour later)
Homer Simpson: Hmmm, bait.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car)
Homer Simpson: Whoa, better get some gas.
Homer Simpson: Fill 'er up. (TO MARGE) I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.
(CAFE: int. cafe/souvenir shop/bait shop - few minutes later)
Worm Man: Where ya headed?
Homer Simpson: Catfish Lake.
Worm Man: Oh, after General Sherman, are ya?
Homer Simpson: Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?
Worm Man: He's only the biggest catfish in these parts...
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah.
Worm Man: ... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds.
Homer Simpson: Whoa, who says that?
Worm Man: They do.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Worm Man: Now, that there's the only known picture of the General. Can't see what he is, exactly. He's freakishly big, though.
Homer Simpson: (THINKS) Hmmmm. (ANNOUNCEMENT) Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car)
Bart Simpson: After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty Burger and head for the arcade.
Lisa Simpson: (TO BART) Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?
Bart Simpson: Lis, in these crazy, topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or wrong? But right now my gut's telling me... Bleed Gramps dry.
(RETREAT: ext. retreat)
(Retreat Cabin: int. retreat cabin)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. Welcome!
Marge Simpson: Hello, Reverend. We're glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen.
HELEN: Hel-lo Marge!
Ned Flanders: Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine?
Homer Simpson: None of your business, Flanders.
Homer Simpson: Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer. It takes a whole weekend to do that.
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (PATTING HOMER ON THE SHOULDER) We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage (CHUCKLE) won't be the one that got away.
Homer Simpson: I see. (BEAT) I also understand bowling expressions.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ah, three couples... our best turnout yet. Why don't we go around the room and everyone can introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about why they're here. (TO COUPLE) John... Gloria?
Gloria: My name's Gloria. I'm here because Johnny boy hasn't been able to cut it, manwise, for some time. Not that I'd want his odor of gin and sour defeat pressed against me.
John: That's enough, Gloria!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Thank you, Gloria. John, why don't you tell us a little about why you're here?
John: She never cooks, she keeps a filthy house and she talks profanely. She's the Queen of the Harpies.
Gloria: No, I'm not!
John: Queen of the Harpies!
Gloria: No, I'm not!
John: Here's your crown, your Majesty.
Gloria: Get away from me, swine.
John: Queen of the Harpies!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: You've come to the right place. First, I want you to look into each other's eyes.
John: (GASPS) Your eyes? (DREAMILY) I'd forgotten how beautiful they are.
Gloria: Let's never fight again.
John: We were fools to argue.
Gloria: Let's not talk about that.
John: Let's not talk at all.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Remember my saving your lives and bringing you happiness when we pass the collection plate next week. All right. Ned, Maude, what brings you here?
Ned Flanders: Well...
Maude Flanders: Go on, Neddie.
Ned Flanders: Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers.
Homer Simpson: Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Homer, why are you here?
Homer Simpson: (INTO HIS CHEST) Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress. (POINTS HIS HEAD TOWARDS MAUDE)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: No, no, Homer. Marge is going to tell us all your faults. Why don't you tell us about hers?
Homer Simpson: She's perfect.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Come on, Homer. What are her faults?
Homer Simpson: Well, sometimes that can be annoying.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now, Marge. Don't interrupt. You'll get your turn.
Homer Simpson: I'm done.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Okay. Marge?
Marge Simpson: Well, it's not that I don't love the guy. I'm always sticking up for him. It's just that he's so self-centered.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now, Homer.
Marge Simpson: He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes...
Homer Simpson: (CRYING) It's true. It's all true.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Homer, don't interrupt.
Homer Simpson: Sorry.
Marge Simpson: He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle...
Homer Simpson: I only did that a couple of times.
(Supermarket: int. supermarket)
Lisa Simpson: Half a gallon of chocolate.
Bart Simpson: Check.
Lisa Simpson: Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
Bart Simpson: Check.
Lisa Simpson: Half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip.
Bart Simpson: Check.
Grampa Simpson: Did your Mom really write that shopping list?
Lisa Simpson: Grampa, what a question?
Bart Simpson: What's next, Lis?
Lisa Simpson: Sprinkles and syrup.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Grampa. Aisle six and step on it.
Grampa Simpson: Well, all right, but put out that cigar.
(RETREAT: int. retreat)
Marge Simpson: ... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that's it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That's all I can think of right now. I guess you're all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, we've missed the luau. What say we call it a night?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Captain: I don't want to hear it, McBain. That cannon of yours is against regulations. In this department we go by the book.
Grampa Simpson: You know, kids, it's gettin' pretty late.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. We've had a big day.
Lisa Simpson: It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.
(Dormitory Cabin: int. dormitory cabin - five a.m.)
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. (LAUGHS). The perfect crime.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? I can't believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. You're thinking about fishing, even when I'm talking... right now. Right?
Homer Simpson: Would this be a good time to be honest?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Homer Simpson: You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?
Marge Simpson: Get back in bed.
Homer Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: (UNHAPPY) All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
(Lake: ext. lake - dawn)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.
Homer Simpson: Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!
(Catfish Lake: ext. catfish lake - boat)
Homer Simpson: Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it.
(Simpson Cabin: int. simpson cabin - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Homer?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen)
Grampa Simpson: Sugar?
Lisa Simpson: Yes. Ten please.
Bart Simpson: (SHAKY) Hey Grampa, top me off.
Grampa Simpson: Are you sure your ma lets you kids drink coffee?
Bart Simpson: (EXPLODING) For the last time, yes!
(Catfish Lake: ext. catfish lake - int. row boat - a little later)
Homer Simpson: Good! Give up!
Homer Simpson: (CONFUSED) Huh?
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Bart Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Hey, Milhouse. Big blowout at Casa de Simpson. The only adult is frail and old.
(Van Houten Home: int. milhouse's house)
Milhouse Van Houten: (INTO PHONE) Bart's joint. Uh, twoish. Be there or be square.
(School Bus Garage: int. school bus garage)
Otto Mann: Tell my friends? All right, but I've got some pretty funky friends.
(Jail: int. jail)
Convict: All right! I get out at noon and I'm already invited to a party.
(RETREAT: int. retreat - day)
Helen Lovejoy: Now, this is a trust exercise. You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you.
Marge Simpson: Do I have to do this?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: No. Even if your husband were here, I wouldn't recommend it. Marge, as a trained marriage counselor, this is the first instance where I've ever told one partner that they were 100 percent right. It's all his fault, and I'm willing to put that in a certificate you can frame.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bathroom)
Grampa Simpson: (SINGING) Over there / Send the word / Send the word / Over there.
Grampa Simpson: (SINGING) That the Yanks are comin'...
(Catfish Lake: ext. catfish lake - int. row boat)
Homer Simpson: Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... (SEARCHING) that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show.
Homer Simpson: Whoa! Holy mackerel!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, good to see you, pal. What's happening, man?
Otto Mann: Cherry party, Bart. Any chicks over eight?
Bart Simpson: Not yet, but the afternoon is young.
Bart Simpson: Lisa, what's wrong?
Lisa Simpson: Isn't it obvious? We've degraded ourselves and set back the children's rights movement for decades to come.
Bart Simpson: (SARCASTIC) You're great at a party, Lisa. Really great.
Grampa Simpson: Hey you, no, shut that door! Stop it! Put that away! No, stop, oh!
Grampa Simpson: OW!
Nelson Muntz: Haw haw haw!
Grampa Simpson: You young hellion, do you want me to take off my belt?
Nelson Muntz: Yeah.
Grampa Simpson: All right. I'll show you.
Nelson Muntz: Haw! Haw! Haw!
Grampa Simpson: Doggone it!
(Catfish Lake: ext. catfish lake - int. row boat)
Homer Simpson: (PUNCHING) I love you, but I must kill you.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson HOUSE - living room)
Bart Simpson: Yeah, take care, man. Hey, thanks for coming. (TO NELSON) Hey, nice tie, Nelson..
Nelson Muntz: Ah, thanks, it's your dad's.
Grampa Simpson: (SOBBING) I tried to be a good baby-sitter, but I failed! (SOBS) I'm a feeb... a useless old... worn-out... (CRYING)
Bart Simpson: Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant feeling I've never had before.
Lisa Simpson: It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth.
Bart Simpson: Well, how do you make this feeling go away?
Lisa Simpson: You grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
(Catfish Lake: EXT. CATFISH LAKE - int. row boat)
Homer Simpson: (SINGING) I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!
Homer Simpson: Uh, oh.
Homer Simpson: Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Marge Simpson: (ANGRILY) We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe....
Homer Simpson: Marge, you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero.
Marge Simpson: To who?
Homer Simpson: To those weirdos in the worm store.
Marge Simpson: All this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
Homer Simpson: Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back.
Marge Simpson: Oh yeah, sure.
Homer Simpson: Watch.
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF, AMAZED) Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. (TO MARGE) And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh, Homer.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - a little later)
Homer Simpson: We're back!
Lisa Simpson: How's your marriage?
Homer Simpson: Same as usual. Perfectomundo.
Marge Simpson: Oh my, the house looks wonderful. Grampa, what's your secret?
Grampa Simpson: Pretending to cry. (LAUGHING) That's right, you heard me. Pretending to cry. (CRYING) I can turn it on and off like a fawcet. Boo-hoo, Oh, I'm crying, I'm so sad. (LAUGHING)
Lisa Simpson: Way to go, Grampa.
Bart Simpson: I'll never trust another old person.
Grampa Simpson: I fooled you. So long suckers. Hee hee hee.
(BAIT SHOP: int. bait shop - day)
Worm Man: Yup. General Sherman. They say he's 500 pounds of bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know? No one knows how old he is, but if you ask me, and most people do, he's a hundred years if he's a day.
Customer: And uh, no one's ever caught him?
Worm Man: Well, one fella came close. Went by the name of Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. And his eyes were like steel, cold and hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of hell.
(Simpson Car: INT. SIMPSON CAR - DAY)
Lisa Simpson: Hurry, Mom! If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone.
Bart Simpson: Wow! Number nine! That's before Fallout Boy became his ward.
Bart Simpson: What do you care about good comics? All you ever buy is Casper the Wimpy Ghost.
Lisa Simpson: I think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and I hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity.
Bart Simpson: Well, you know what I think? I think Casper's the ghost of Richie Rich.
Lisa Simpson: Hey, they do look alike!
Bart Simpson: I wonder how Richie died?
Lisa Simpson: Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life.
Marge Simpson: Kids, could you lighten up a little?
Bart Simpson: (TO LISA, HOLDING UP COMIC) Now, Radioactive Man: He rules! Never punches a bad guy without saying something cool.
Lisa Simpson: He's no wittier than the next superhero.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah? Look. (SHOWS COMIC) He knocks a guy into the sun and says, "Hot enough for ya?"
Lisa Simpson: (CHUCKLES) I stand corrected.
Marge Simpson: We're here!
(Springfield Convention Center: ext. springfield convention center - continuous)
(Springfield Convention Center: int. convention center - a minute later)
Lisa Simpson: Too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
Bart Simpson: This looks like a discount for...
Bart Simpson: Bartman!
Ticket Seller: Who are you supposed to be?
Bart Simpson: (À LA MICHAEL KEATON) I'm Bartman!
Ticket Seller: Never heard of him. Full price.
Bart Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Lousy rip off...
DIAMOND JOE: (KENNEDY VOICE) Is uh, this on?... Ahem, young people of Springfield: As your Mayor, I'd like to welcome you to our annual funny book convention, and thank you for pumping almost three hundred dollars into the local economy.
DIAMOND JOE: Your youthful high spirits have imparted a glow to this old war-horse. (JOKING) You might say I feel like Radiation Man!
Jimbo Jones: That's Radioactive Man, jerk!
DIAMOND JOE: I stand corrected... Well, have fun and be sure to clear out by six for the Shriners. (TO ASSISTANT) Get that punk's name. No one makes a fool out of Diamond Joe Quimby.
Martin Prince: Excuse me, sir. Has anyone turned in a left Vulcan ear?
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Lost And Found Guy: (RUMMAGING THROUGH BOX) Let's see, we've got a utility belt, a couple of tricorders, a light saber... Sorry, kid.
Otto Mann: Hey, Bart-dude!
Bart Simpson: Hey, Otto-man! Oooh, what's that?
Otto Mann: My very own idea for a comic book, little man. It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night, fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic warzone!
Bart Simpson: Cool!
Milhouse Van Houten: C'mon, Bart. We're going to see Buddy Hodges.
Bart Simpson: The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV?
Milhouse Van Houten: Yep.
Bart Simpson: Wow, I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam.
Radioactive Man: Aaahh... These Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil.
Fallout Boy: Gee whillikers, Radioactive Man. Wisht I was old enough to smoke Laramies.
Radioactive Man: Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're sixteen.
Radioactive Man: Look out!
Announcer: Will Radioactive Man act in time to save the earth?
Convention Director: Well, wasn't that great?... Y'know, kids, I'm sure we'd all like to remember actor Dirk Richter for his portrayal of Radioactive Man, and not the sordid details of his final years, so let's keep the questions tasteful, okay? Now how about a big welcome for Buddy "Fallout Boy" Hodges!
BUDDY: Any questions?
Milhouse Van Houten: When Radioactive Man got injected with shrinking serum in issue two-thirty-four, how come his costume shrinks, too?
BUDDY: (PURSES LIPS) I am sure I don't know. But I did just finish playing Rum Tum Tugger in the second national touring company of "Cats" -- anybody see it?
Bart Simpson: (RAISING HAND, INTERRUPTING) Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Over here, Fallout Boy! Oh, oh, me... me... me... me, me.
BUDDY: (POINTING TO BART) Yes, you, the masked boy.
Bart Simpson: (EARNESTLY) Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his bullet-riddled body was found?
BUDDY: (UPSET) Dirk Richter was a beautiful man. Can't you little vultures leave him alone?
Nelson Muntz: Hey, Radioactive Man number seventy-two! It's the imaginary tale where Radioactive Man marries Larva Girl.
Dealer: Tell you what. I'll show you something very special if you promise to put your grubby little hands behind your back and keep 'em there.
Dealer: (OPENS PORTFOLIO) Behold!
Bart Simpson: (QUIET AWE) Wow. Radioactive Man Number One.
Dealer: None other.
Bart Simpson: I bet it's worth a million bucks!
Dealer: It is, my lad. But I'll let you have it for a hundred because you remind me of me.
Bart Simpson: (DISMAYED) All I got is thirty.
Dealer: Then you cannot have it.
Bart Simpson: But I must. Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know... to buy that comic book.
Dealer: Your emotion is out of place here, son.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - continuous)
Marge Simpson: So, did you kids have fun?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, Mom! Guess what? For a dollar a man sold me thirty-five Caspers and a dozen Lois Lanes.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh.
Homer Simpson: I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! (GROWLS) And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time. (BARKS) (HOWLS)
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: I was just kidding, Marge. (CHANGING SUBJECT) Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!
Bart Simpson: (KISSING UP) All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger!
Homer Simpson: (SUSPICIOUS) All right, what are you getting at?
Bart Simpson: I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
Homer Simpson: A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?
Bart Simpson: Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world.
Homer Simpson: Well, t.s.
(Krusty Burger: int. krusty burger - a little later)
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.

Homer Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Homer Simpson: (SHOUTING) No! (KINDLY) Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.

Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: (AFTER A PAUSE, SCREAMING) Okay.
Homer Simpson: (GLOATING) Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!
Marge Simpson: Don't gloat, Homer. (TO BART) You know, Bart, when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents wouldn't give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma...
(Bouvier House: int. bouvier house - sisters' room - 1963)
Young Patty: (TO MARGE) We'll give you half our allowance.
Young Selma: Uh-huh. But you have to be our slave.
Young Patty: (TO SELMA) This gives us a lot more free time.
Young Selma: Uh-huh. Let's take up smoking.
Marge Simpson: For months, I worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked...
Older Patty: (SINGING ALONG) Venus... Oh, Venus...
Older Selma: (TO MARGE) We want those dress-shields hand-washed and drip-dried.
Nelson Muntz: Haw haw!
Mrs. Glick: Here we are.
Marge Simpson: But the big day finally came. And because I'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good.
(Krusty Burger: int. krusty burger - continuous)
Marge Simpson: So maybe a part-time job is the answer.
Bart Simpson: Aw, Mom, I couldn't ask you to do that. You're already taking care of Maggie, and Lisa is such a handful --
Lisa Simpson: She means you should get a job, stupid.
Bart Simpson: Me?
Adult Narrator: Get a job! Were they serious? I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever.
Homer Simpson: Bart! What are you staring at?
Bart Simpson: Uh... nothing.
Adult Narrator: He didn't say it, and neither did I, but at that moment my dad and I were closer than we ever...
Homer Simpson: Bart! Stop it!
Bart Simpson: Sorry.
(Simpson Home: INT. simpson house - LIVING ROOM - day)
Bart Simpson: (SINGS) "I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY..." AHH
Bart Simpson: Empty bottles... empty bottles...
Bart Simpson: Hm... well, it's practically empty.
(QUIK-E-MART: int. quik-e-mart - later)
Bart Simpson: Here you go, Apu.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Ooh, very good. Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a Jumbo Cherry Squishie?
Bart Simpson: No, not today. I need the dime.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (RINGING IT UP) Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade.
(Simpson Home: INT. simpson house - bart's room)
Bart Simpson: Ah-ha!
(Springfield Bank: int. springfield bank - later)
Bart Simpson: Americanize this, my good man.
Teller: (CHARLES BRONSON VOICE) Okey dokey.
Bart Simpson: All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
Teller: Let the good times roll.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - CURB - AFTERNOON)
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Oh, this is so humiliating... I feel like such a geek.
Lisa Simpson: How's it going, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Terrible. Cars slow down to laugh at me, but no one's buying.
Lisa Simpson: Maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. Lets see...
Lisa Simpson: Ah ha, now you look pathetic.
Bart Simpson: Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Let's see... (CONSIDERS) ... (SEES SOMETHING) Ah!
Bart Simpson: Form a line, no crowding. Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear... Step right up.
Barney Gumble: Ah, Bart could you give me one on credit? I'm a little short this week.
Bart Simpson: Beat it.
Eddie: Say, uh, you got a liquor license there, young fella?
Bart Simpson: (SWAGGERING) Ugh, my dog ate it.
Lou: (WRITING TICKET) Gotta have a license to sell beer.
Bart Simpson: Say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. How about a couple on the house?
Eddie: (CONSIDERS) We-ell, seeing as how it's a first offense...
Lou: I guess we can overlook this.
Bart Simpson: So long, officers. (SEES HOMER) Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Hey, what's all the -- (GASPS)
Homer Simpson: (WEEPING) My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
(Beauty Parlor: int. beauty parlor - next afternoon)
Marge Simpson: The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
Mrs. Glick: A comic book! Oh, my, boys never change. Which one is it, "Nazi Smasher"?
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) I don't think so.
Mrs. Glick: Send him over to my house, I got a few chores he could do. He knows how to mix whitewash, don't he?
(MRS. GLICK'S HOUSE: EXT. MRS. GLICK'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING)
Bart Simpson: (HESITANT) Mrs. Glick?
Mrs. Glick: Eh, you must be Burt Simpson! Well, you look like you've got a strong young back!
Mrs. Glick: Would you like something to eat? I've got dried apricots... almond paste, sauerkraut candy.
Bart Simpson: No, thanks. (POINTS AT PHOTO) Who's that?
Mrs. Glick: Oh, that's my brother, Asa. He was killed in the Great War. Held a grenade too long.
(WORLD WORLD I BATTLEFIELD: ext. WORLD WORLD i battlefield)
Asa: This one's for you Kaiser Bill. Special delivery from Uncle Sam and all the boys in D Company: Yeah! Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob and Reggie. Yeah, even Reggie. He ain't so stuck-up once you get to know...
Mrs. Glick: Here, have some ribbon candy. Boys love candy.
Bart Simpson: No, thanks.
Mrs. Glick: (INSISTENT) Boys love candy.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yes, ma'am!
Bart Simpson: Ugh, I think I'd rather just get to work, Ma'am.
Mrs. Glick: (GRABBING HIM) We'll start with a little light yard work. And when you're done, you can have a nice barley pop.
(GLICK HOUSE: ext. glick house - back yard - continuous)
Mrs. Glick: I want you to clear out all the weeds. You do know which ones are weeds?
Bart Simpson: All of 'em?
Mrs. Glick: Good boy.
Mrs. Glick: Now be careful with these. I'll be inside watching my stories.
Bart Simpson: Ow!. . .Ow!
Soap Actress: (FROM TV) Jack, please. I'm married.
Soap Actor: (FROM TV) That must be what's turning me on.
Soap Actress: Oh... Stop it... some more.
Mrs. Glick: Filthy, but genuinely arousing.
Bart Simpson: Finished.
Mrs. Glick: Merciful heavens, you're bleeding! (EXITING) I'll get the iodine.
Mrs. Glick: Now, don't fidget.
Bart Simpson: Listen, lady, you don't have to -- YAAAUUUUGGGHHH!
Mrs. Glick: (OVER SCREAM) They've never improved on iodine.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - later afternoon)
Bart Simpson: Hi, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Did you make any money?
Bart Simpson: Not yet, but at least I'm in a lot of pain.
Marge Simpson: Well, I think what you're doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn't have anybody.
Bart Simpson: There's a reason.
Mrs. Glick: (CHEERFUL) The sludge certainly collects around those downspouts, don't it?
Bart Simpson: (MUTTERING UNDER HIS BREATH) I'll sludge you, you old bat.
Mrs. Glick: Today, we wash Beulah. Do you know what that is?
Bart Simpson: Some old lady thing, nobody's heard about for fifty years?
Mrs. Glick: No, it was my wedding dress, but then I dyed it black and it became my mourning dress.
Bart Simpson: Great story, lady.
Bart Simpson: Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms.
Bart Simpson: No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH!
(GLICK HOUSE: int. glick house - foyer)
Mrs. Glick: Well, it's payday. I'll wager you've been looking forward to this.
Chimp: (HAPPY CHIMP NOISE)
Mrs. Glick: Two quarters.
Bart Simpson: Two quarters?
Mrs. Glick: You deserve every penny. You know, I've told a lot of my girlfriends about you and they have chores too.
Bart Simpson: Two quarters!
Mrs. Glick: Bart, you didn't say thank you.
Bart Simpson: Listen lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can leave without saying a bad word, but there's no way that I am saying thank you.
Mrs. Glick: You're welcome. All right then, off you go, to spend it on penny whistles and moon pies.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER)
Bart Simpson: (GRUMBLING) Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her...
Homer Simpson: What's the problem, boy?
Bart Simpson: I've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents.
Homer Simpson: Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.
Bart Simpson: (SKEPTICAL) Really?
Homer Simpson: (PAUSE) Nah.
Bart Simpson: Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps.
Homer Simpson: Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out.
(The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop: ext. the android's dungeon and baseball card shop - day)
Martin Prince: Can you let me have it for forty dollars?
Dealer: Forty bucks? Forget it! You made me get off my stool for that?
Martin Prince: It's all I've got. I sold seeds. I visited my aunt in the nursing home. I fished a dime out of the sewer, for God's sake!
Dealer: No way. (TO BART) What do you want?
Bart Simpson: Can I have it for thirty-five?
Dealer: No!... No!... Freakin' kids. I do not need this, I've got a Masters degree in folklore and mythology.
Milhouse Van Houten: Excuse me, do you have the Carl Yastrzemski baseball card from 1973, when he had big sideburns?
Dealer: Show me the thirty bucks, because if you ain't got it, I ain't gettin' off the stool.
Bart Simpson: Wait a minute, Martin. If you, Milhouse and I went in together, we could buy a copy of "Radioactive Man No. 1" right now!
Martin Prince: Wow!
Dealer: Here you go. "Muttonchop Yaz."
Milhouse Van Houten: I don't want it.
Dealer: Freakin' kids!
Bart Simpson: Look, pal. We've got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy "Radioactive Man No. 1". So why don't you just waddle over there and get it.
Dealer: (IMPRESSED) Yes sir.
Bart Simpson: Wow! Breathe it in, boys!
Martin Prince: This is the stuff dreams are made of.
Milhouse Van Houten: It smells like my grandpa.
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home.
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh.
Dealer: Looks like you bought more than you bargained for.
(Bart's Treehouse: int. tree house - a little later)
Radioactive Man: My pants... caught on barbed wire... Good Lord Choke... an A-bomb!
Radioactive Man: Yaarrgh!
Radioactive Man: I'm becoming radioactive. From this day forward, I shall call myself Radioactive Man.
Milhouse Van Houten: (HUSHED) So that's how it happened!
Martin Prince: I would've thought being hit by an atomic bomb would have killed him.
Bart Simpson: Now you know better.
Milhouse Van Houten: Turn the page, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Listen, you guys are welcome to come over and read it any time you like.
Milhouse Van Houten: Why can't we keep it at my house?
Bart Simpson: Your house? That's crazy talk!
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, the comic's ours as much as it is yours.
Martin Prince: How about this, guys. Bart can have it Mondays and Thursdays. Milhouse will get it Tuesdays and Fridays. And yours truly will take it Wednesdays and Saturdays.
Bart Simpson: Perfect.
Milhouse Van Houten: Wait a minute. What about Sunday?
Bart Simpson: Yeah. What about Sunday?
Martin Prince: Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number generator. I will take the digits one through three. Milhouse will have four through six. And Bart will have seven through nine.
Bart Simpson: Perfect.
Milhouse Van Houten: Wait a minute. What about zero?
Bart Simpson: Yeah! What about zero?
Milhouse Van Houten: Yeah.
Martin Prince: Well, in the unlikely event of a zero, possession will be determined by "Rock, Scissor, Paper" competition. Best three out of five, how's that?
Martin Prince: Excellent! Well, today being Saturday, Gentlemen, I guess I'll be taking my comic and...
Bart Simpson: (MENACINGLY) Uh, uh, uh, ah nice try, Martin. It almost worked. But tonight, this comic book stays right here.
Martin Prince: If the comic book stays right here, then so do I.
Milhouse Van Houten: Me too!
Bart Simpson: Fine. We're all going to stay here with the comic book. It'll be like a sleep-over. Yeah, a sleep-over. That's what pals do, right? Real friendly-like.
Milhouse Van Houten: I want to read it again.
Bart Simpson: Nice try, mister.
Martin Prince: Milhouse, the acids in your hands could damage the newsprint. We want to keep this comic forever, so the last one alive will have the honor of being buried with it.
Bart Simpson: (SUSPICIOUSLY) What do you mean, the last one alive?
Martin Prince: I meant years from now.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, sure you did.
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, don't push him!
Bart Simpson: I knew it. You're both against me! Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholemew J. Simpson.
Marge Simpson: I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
Milhouse Van Houten: (GASPING FOR AIR) Thank you, Mrs. Simpson.
Bart Simpson: Sweet dreams, boys.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - back yard - night)
(Bart's Treehouse: int. tree house - late at night)
Bart Simpson: One more step and you're a dead man.
Martin Prince: I have to go to the bathroom, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, right, so do I, but you don't see me gettin' up.
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey, what's going on?
Bart Simpson: Our dear friend Martin was trying to steal the comic book.
Milhouse Van Houten: Let's tie him up!
Martin Prince: Bart, is this how you treat all your guests?
Bart Simpson: Hmp, impressive.
Bart Simpson: Quiet, Piggy, or we'll stick an apple in your mouth. (TO MILHOUSE) We can't take any chances. We'll have to take turns watching him.
Milhouse Van Houten: Okay. I'll go first.
Bart Simpson: Oh, so that's your little game. Let old Bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!
Bart Simpson: Well, it is not going to happen, see?
Milhouse Van Houten: You're going crazy, Bart. I'm telling your mom!
Bart Simpson: Hey Martin, tell him what we do with squealers.
Martin Prince: I don't know. Is it worse than what you do with people that have to go to the bathroom?
Milhouse Van Houten: (TO BART) You can't stop me.
Bart Simpson: The hell I can't!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Marge Simpson: Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?
Homer Simpson: They're fine.
(Bart's Treehouse: int. tree house - continuous)
Martin Prince: Bart, the comic!
Milhouse Van Houten: Don't let go of me Bart!
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, it's not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit.
Milhouse Van Houten: No, Bart! No!
Martin Prince: (SMUGLY) You know, if you guys hadn't tied me up, I could be saving the comic as we speak.
Bart Simpson: Shut up! Shut up!
Milhouse Van Houten: Help me, Bart! I didn't even want the comic. I wanted Carl Yastrzemski with the big side-burns.
Marge Simpson: Boys, you better come in the house. You don't want to get the sniffles.
Bart Simpson: Aw, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Now come on... (LOOKING AT MARTIN) You can play your little tie-up game inside. I've got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows?
Martin Prince: I'd raise my hand, Mrs. Simpson, if I could.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - the next morning)
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Martin Prince: (SAD) It's no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came.
Bart Simpson: We worked so hard and now it's all gone... We ended up with nothing because the three of us can't share.
Milhouse Van Houten: What's your point?
Bart Simpson: Nothing. It just kind of ticks me off.
Radioactive Man: Well, the world is safe again... but for how long?
(HILL NEAR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT: ext. hill near nuclear power plant - morning)
Mayor Joe Quimby: Ah, Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests. I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. In the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of Springfield, what to do.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign. (LAUGH)
Mayor Joe Quimby: And now, I would like to present the man who made this sign possible, by dropping the last of his obstructionist legal challenges... Montgomery Burns.
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns is never late. Something must be terribly wrong.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Well, there better be. Nobody leaves Diamond Joe Quimby holding the bag!
(Burns Manor: int. burns mansion - master bedroom - morning)
C. Montgomery Burns: (GRUNTING) Must... turn... over. Got to... greet... dignitaries!
Waylon Smithers: Oh, no, Mr. Burns! We've got to get a doctor!
C. Montgomery Burns: Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me! As long as there's an ounce of strength left in me, I...
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Mmmm. Mr. Burns is suffering from what we medical men call hypohemia. In layman's terms it's quite simply a lack of blood.
Waylon Smithers: (ANXIOUSLY) Damn it, doctor, I'm no idiot! I know what hypohemia is. What I want to know is what can we do about it?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, at this point, our only hope is a transfusion.
Waylon Smithers: How long does it take to sterilize a needle?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: A few seconds.
Waylon Smithers: Well, skip it.
Waylon Smithers: Just leave me enough to get home.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (CHUCKLING) I'm afraid it's not that simple. His blood type is Double-O-Negative. It's quite rare.
Waylon Smithers: (ANGUISHED MOAN) But I'm B positive. Damn this common gutter blood in my veins!
C. Montgomery Burns: (WEAKLY) Smithers, don't feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. nuclear power plant - afternoon)
Homer Simpson: How many hairs on my head? Without looking!
Waylon Smithers: (BRAVELY) Go ahead.
Chimp: (PLEASED GRUNTING)
Waylon Smithers: (OVER P.A. - DISTRAUGHT) Attention all employees. Our boss and inspiration, Mr. Burns... is at death (CHOKES UP)... death's door. If you have type Double-O-Negative blood, I implore you to report to the Bloodmobile outside. That is all.
Carl Carlson: I'd give him my blood, except for one thing.
Lenny Leonard: What's that?
Carl Carlson: I don't wanna. (LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: (INCREDULOUS) I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job.
Carl Carlson: You know, Homer, I am your supervisor.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, sir.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - evening)
Lisa Simpson: Maggie, look. What's that?
Lisa Simpson: Lee-mur. Lee-mur.
Lisa Simpson: Zee-boo. Zee-boo.
Marge Simpson: What are you doing, honey?
Lisa Simpson: I'm trying to teach Maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. I want her to have all the advantages that I didn't have.
Marge Simpson: (OFFENDED) Lisa, we did the best we could... What's a zebu?
Lisa Simpson: It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. (SINGSONG TO MAGGIE) Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap.
Homer Simpson: Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?
Marge Simpson: A-Positive.
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it.
Lisa Simpson: You know his blood type, how romantic.
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR) A mother knows everything about her family.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, yeah? What's my shoe size?
Marge Simpson: Four B.
Bart Simpson: How many teeth do I have?
Marge Simpson: Sixteen permanent, eight baby.
Homer Simpson: Earmuffs.
Marge Simpson: XL.
Lisa Simpson: Ring.
Marge Simpson: I don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three.
Bart Simpson: Allergies.
Marge Simpson: Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.
Bart Simpson: And?
Marge Simpson: Glow in the dark monster make-up.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type?
Homer Simpson: Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it.
Marge Simpson: Bart does.
Homer Simpson: (ECSTATIC) Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!
Bart Simpson: Hey, wait a minute. I don't have to give blood. I have rights, you know.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, you have the right to remain silent.
Marge Simpson: Bart, you have to help someone in need. It's the only decent thing to do.
Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer Simpson: Bart, it's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. Don't you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?
Bart Simpson: Is it a Bible story?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches.
Bart Simpson: How did a lion get rich?
Homer Simpson: It was the olden days!
Bart Simpson: Oh.
(Bloodmobile: ext. bloodmobile - next morning)
Homer Simpson: (KNOCKING) Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!
Otto Mann: Just a sec, man!
(BACK OF BLOODMOBILE: ext. back of bloodmobile - continuous)
Bart Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Whoa, Otto-man! You work here?
Otto Mann: Oh yeah! During the day, all my friends are in school, so I got a job as a Certified Bloodletting Tech Dude.
Homer Simpson: Now let's get the show on the road.
Otto Mann: Okay. Let me wash up.
Waylon Smithers: Homer, brave young Bart. I don't know which one to hug first.
Homer Simpson: Eh.... the boy.
(Hospital: Ext. hospital - day)
Dr. Julius Hibbert: We're ready with the transfusion.
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, I'm not going to make it. I want to dictate... my epitaph.
C. Montgomery Burns: "Charles... Montgomery... Burns." (BEAT)
Waylon Smithers: Um, hmm.
C. Montgomery Burns: "American Patriot"
C. Montgomery Burns: "... American Patriot."
C. Montgomery Burns: (STRONGER) "Master Of The Atom."
C. Montgomery Burns: (STRONGER) "Scourge Of The Despot."
C. Montgomery Burns: (BOOMING) "O Tyrant Hear His Mighty Name And QUAKE!!" Smithers, I'm back!
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - NEXT MORNING)
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, top o' the mornin' to ye! Why, look who's here! It's good old... you!
Smitty: (PUZZLED) Hi, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SEES LENNY) (CHUCKLES) Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm?
Homer Simpson: (AMAZED) Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!
(Burns's Private Fronton: int. burns' private fronton - later)
Osvaldo: Aye, caramba!
C. Montgomery Burns: Heh-heh-heh! Well, that's game! Hasta manana, Osvaldo!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, I'm back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar!
Waylon Smithers: Just remarkable, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad's name?
Waylon Smithers: Uh, Bart Simpson, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Who?
Waylon Smithers: He's the son of Homer Simpson. One of your stiffs in Sector 7-G.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed. (LAUGH)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - evening)
Homer Simpson: Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... (GASPS) (SEES RETURN ADDRESS) Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!
Homer Simpson: Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
Homer Simpson: Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!
Lisa Simpson: Yes, Dad.
Homer Simpson: It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check.
Marge Simpson: The meaning of what?
Homer Simpson: "Better half," Marge. "Better half."
(Radio Station: ext. radio station - night)
Homer Simpson: All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. (READS) "Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns." (ANNOYED GRUNT) It's just a card!
Homer Simpson: This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. (FURIOUS) That's what got me so mad in the first place.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in (FAIRY VOICE) a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats...
Bart Simpson: Yeah, Mom. We got hosed!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: (FIRMLY) We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance.
Homer Simpson: I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter.
Homer Simpson: (DICTATING) "Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!" Could you read that last part back to me?
Bart Simpson: (MATTER OF FACTLY) "You stink."
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Good. "You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."
Bart Simpson: An elephant's butt?
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) "An elephant's butt."
(Sidewalk: ext. sidewalk - night)
Marge Simpson: But he's your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute?
Homer Simpson: Yup!
Marge Simpson: You're still angry, Homer. Why don't you sleep on it?
Homer Simpson: Forget it, Marge!
Marge Simpson: Please, Homie? For me?
Homer Simpson: (SOFTENING) Oh, all right. (GRUMBLING) You always do that hand thing! And it usually works.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Homer Simpson: Cheap son-of-a...
Marge Simpson: Homer... Breakfast is ready.
Homer Simpson: (IN HIS SLEEP) Hmmm...
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of (TAKING ANOTHER BITE) mmphm hnmph.
Marge Simpson: Oh... thank you.
Homer Simpson: (LOOKS AROUND) Where's the letter?
(CORNER MAILBOX: ext. corner mailbox - morning)
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING)
Homer Simpson: (PANICKED) Where is it? (GROAN)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I don't think it's in the cornstarch canister.
Homer Simpson: (FRANTIC) Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!
Homer Simpson: Bart, have you seen the letter?
Bart Simpson: Yup.
Homer Simpson: All right, (SLOWLY) think very carefully. Where did you see it last?
Bart Simpson: (IMITATING HOMER, SLOWLY) The last place I saw it...
Homer Simpson: Uh huh.
Bart Simpson: ...was in my hand...
Homer Simpson: Yeah...
Bart Simpson: ...as I was shoving it into the mailbox.
Homer Simpson: (PAINED GRUNT) Why did you do that?
Bart Simpson: Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You're an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. So I...
Homer Simpson: I'll show you mad in the morning.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself.
Homer Simpson: (STARTS CRYING) She's right. (TO HIMSELF) Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!
(Street: ext. street - corner mailbox - day)
Homer Simpson: (REACHING AROUND) Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Bart Simpson: Give it up, Homer. It's locked up tight.
Homer Simpson: (SLYLY) Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy.
Barney Gumble: (YELLING) Hey, I'm with you, Homer. (WITH RAISED FIST) Fight the power!
Bart Simpson: Why the hose, Homer?
Homer Simpson: What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?
Homer Simpson: So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: "Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo." Big loss.
Homer Simpson: Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal.
Bart Simpson: Dad, the mailman is here.
Homer Simpson: That's a good one. We'll use that.
Bart Simpson: No, I mean the mailman's here.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMS)
Mail Person: (SEEING HOSE) Dear God! Are you planning to water the mail?
Homer Simpson: Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?
Mail Person: (MALICIOUSLY) That's right.
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm still gonna run!
(Burns Manor: int. burns' mansion - parlor - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia.
Waylon Smithers: Well, sir, Mr. Roman is one of the finest ghostwriters in the business.
Waylon Smithers: He's written "Like Hell I Can't!"... "Up From The Muck"... and "The Unsinkable Sadruddin Mahbaradad!"
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent.
Roman: All right, all right. First question? Have you slept with anyone famous?
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... (GASP) What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I'm not some dizzy starlet who can't string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You're fired.
(Post Office: int. post office - day)
Homer Simpson: (TO POSTAL WORKER; FAKE VOICE) Hello, my name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.
Postal Worker: Okay, Mr. Burns. What's your first name?
Homer Simpson: (CONFIDENT) I don't know.
Homer Simpson: (SOUR) Great plan, Bart.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - day)

Homer Simpson: Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take.
C. Montgomery Burns: Can I help you?
Bart Simpson: (SAD) They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it.
C. Montgomery Burns: (NOTICING) Oh, don't be frightened of this. It's nothing but a letter opener. Who are you?
Homer Simpson: Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, eh? Simpson. (LOOKS AT LETTERS) Oh, why, there's a letter here from you. I'll just read it right now. (READS) "Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your card was just great." (CHUCKLES; TO HOMER) Why, Simpson. You've made my day. You're a true gentleman.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) Yeah, well I'll be on my --
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello, there's more. (CONTINUES READING, DRIPPING WITH SARCASM) "In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic..."
C. Montgomery Burns: (READING) "...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed..." (WITH GROWING ANGER) "...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!"
Homer Simpson: Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?
Joey: (ANNOYED) Homer, I don't tell you how to do your job. Okay?
C. Montgomery Burns: I could crush him like an ant, but it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until... Oh, what the hell. I'll just crush him like an ant.
(Burns Manor: INT. BURNS MANSION - NIGHT)
C. Montgomery Burns: "Senile," eh? "Buck-toothed," am I? "Bony arms," are they? "Liver spots," did I? "Chinless," will you?
Waylon Smithers: His pink slip awaits your signature, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now, that's odd. I've just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers. Have him beaten to a pulp.
Waylon Smithers: But, sir --
C. Montgomery Burns: (THRU HIS TEETH) But what?
Waylon Smithers: Nothing, sir.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - kitchen - night)
Homer Simpson: Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad.
Marge Simpson: (SYMPATHETIC MOAN)
Homer Simpson: Me and my big... letter writing pen!
Marge Simpson: Honey, what's done is done. No matter what happens, we'll pull through. We always do.
Homer Simpson: Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Lisa Simpson: (COMFORTING) That's okay, Bart. Nobody really believed it. We were just trying to scare you.
(SMITHERS' OFFICE: int. smithers' office - day)

(Burns's Study: int. burns' study - night)
C. Montgomery Burns: In closing, gentle reader, I'd like to thank you. What's that you say? Me thanking you? No, it's not a misprint. For you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The end.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHEERILY) Ah Smithers, how'd the beating go?
Waylon Smithers: Sir, uh... there was no beating.
C. Montgomery Burns: What? Well that's a hell of a thing! Why?
Waylon Smithers: Because... I... I called it off.
C. Montgomery Burns: Judas!
Waylon Smithers: I'm sorry, sir. But I just couldn't hurt Homer Simpson. He saved your life.
C. Montgomery Burns: I see.
Waylon Smithers: I know you're mad at me, but I think it's only fair to warn you, I'm going to stand outside the gate until you forgive me.
C. Montgomery Burns: No need, Smithers. As usual, you've been the sober "ying" to my raging "yang." Put 'er there, old pal.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, while I wish this handshake would never end, I'm, I'm afraid we still have the Simpson matter to attend to.
C. Montgomery Burns: We do indeed, old friend. We do indeed.

Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick.
Moe Szyslak: What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.
Homer Simpson: I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one.

Lisa Simpson: Wait, Dad, he's smiling.
Homer Simpson: Mr. Burns, you brought us a present.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why, what did you think I was going to do -- have you beaten to a bloody pulp?
C. Montgomery Burns: To show there's no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, "Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?" (TO BART) And now, young fellow, I haven't forgotten you. Here.
Bart Simpson: (DELIGHTED) Wow! A crowbar!
Lisa Simpson: It's to open the crate, stupid.
Homer Simpson: (ASIDE TO MARGE) What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls...
Bart Simpson: (SURPRISED) Wow! A big ugly head!
C. Montgomery Burns: (AMUSED) Actually, son, it's a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt'tapalatakettle, the god of war.
Bart Simpson: Awesome!
Lisa Simpson: (SWEETLY) No, Maggie. Not Az-tec. Ol-mec. Ol-mec.
Homer Simpson: Marge, what does it do?
Marge Simpson: It doesn't do anything.
Homer Simpson: (IRRITATED) Marge! Really, what does it do?
Marge Simpson: Whatever it does, it's doing it now.
C. Montgomery Burns: (PLEASED) Well, I'll let you get acquainted with Señor Xt'tapalatakettle. Ta!
C. Montgomery Burns: Did you see their faces, Smithers?
Waylon Smithers: Sir, you're my god of generosity.
Homer Simpson: (BITTERLY) Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock.
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head.
Marge Simpson: Homer, it's the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, "A good deed is its own reward."
Bart Simpson: Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool!
Marge Simpson: Well then, I guess the moral is, "No good deed goes unrewarded."
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!
Marge Simpson: Well... then I guess the moral is, "The squeaky wheel gets the grease."
Lisa Simpson: Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
Homer Simpson: Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
Marge Simpson: But it certainly was a memorable few days!
Homer Simpson: Amen to that!

Bart Simpson: Well, what do you know? I'm relieved.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, my birthday is in two days. I'm gonna be eight years old. It's a big number -- almost double digits.
Bart Simpson: Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore --
Bart Simpson: Lisa did it.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?
Bart Simpson: Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he?
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I've made things for you. But you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all...
Bart Simpson: (OVERLAPPING) Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! I'm doing it! Birthday gift coming your way!

Bart Simpson: (FROM BEHIND THE BOX) Can do.
Bart Simpson: Hm... Krusty hotline.
Krusty the Clown: Hi kids! You've reached the Krusty Hotline. If you haven't asked your parents' permission, naughty naughty! But Krusty forgives you! Two dollars for the first minute, fifty cents for each additional minute. (LONG LAUGH THAT DOESN'T STOP)
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS, THEN) Thanks for calling kids! A new message every day.
Marge Simpson: (SHOCKED) Maggie!
Marge Simpson: Bart, I asked you to watch your sister!
Bart Simpson: I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
Homer Simpson: (PANICKY) Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?
Marge Simpson: I washed it.
Homer Simpson: (WARMLY) Oh thank you, Marge -- (SHRIEKS) Pink?
Homer Simpson: (SCARED) Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different.
Marge Simpson: Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts.
Homer Simpson: Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
Homer Simpson: (FRANTIC) Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! (SOBBING) It's all over, Marge. It's all over.
Marge Simpson: I don't know how this could have happened.
Bart Simpson: Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!
Homer Simpson: You! You did this to me!
Marge Simpson: Homer, please. No one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. nuclear power plant - morning)
C. Montgomery Burns: Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink?
Waylon Smithers: Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir. He's one of your boobs from Sector 7-G.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort of free-thinking anarchist.
Waylon Smithers: I'll call security, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. These color monitors have already paid for themselves.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - corridor)
Lenny Leonard: Hey Homer, we saved you a doughnut.
Carl Carlson: It has pink frosting!
Homer Simpson: Mmm, thanks -- It looks... (CATCHING ON) Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! (LICKING LIPS) Although it is tempting --
Guard #1: (SHARPLY) Drop that doughnut.
Guard #2: Let's go, Pinky.
Homer Simpson: (WHIMPERING) You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
C. Montgomery Burns: Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away!
Waylon Smithers: You know, Mr. Burns, his body cavity search revealed nothing and we must have x-rayed him a hundred times. Maybe he's telling the truth.
C. Montgomery Burns: Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in '79.
Waylon Smithers: Uh, sir, that was my costume from the plant production of H.M.S. Pinafore.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. (RE HOMER) Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. That's all changed, thanks to the "Marvin Monroe Take Home Personality Test." Twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or (AIR QUOTES) meshuggenah, someone is.

Homer Simpson: I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons.
Michael: I can't believe you've never heard of me. I'm a very popular entertainer.

Michael: (LAUGHING) Hee hee hee...
Michael: You seem like a nice guy. Why'd they put you in here?

Bart Simpson: (SKEPTICAL) Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you?
Michael: He could be. It's a big hospital.
Bart Simpson: Aw, come on. If you're really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys?
Michael: Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles.
Bart Simpson: Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives?

Psychiatrist: Mrs. Simpson, I'm sorry but your husband suffers from a persecution complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility.

Bart Simpson: Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?
Homer Simpson: Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend.
Marge Simpson: That's the problem. Even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves.

Homer Simpson: Why not?
Ned Flanders: I sold it to you for seven cents.
Homer Simpson: Oh.

Fat Tony: And what if your family don't like bread, they like cigarettes?
Bart Simpson: I guess that's okay.
Fat Tony: Now, what if instead of giving them away, you sold them at a price that was practically giving them away. Would that be a crime, Bart?

C. Montgomery Burns: Yeah. so, what did you do this weekend, Smithers?
Waylon Smithers: Well, I caught up on my laundry. And wrote a letter to mother. Oh, here's the kicker, I took Hercules out to be clipped.
C. Montgomery Burns: Who the devil is Hercules?
Waylon Smithers: He's my Yorkshire terrier, sir. He's kind of tiny, so... you know, it's a joke. Here's a picture of Herkie.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SARCASTIC) Well, Smithers, don't you know how to paint the town red.
Waylon Smithers: May I ask how you spent your weekend?
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, a bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird.
C. Montgomery Burns: Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time.
Homer Simpson: What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets. (PIG SNORTS)

Marge Simpson: Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things...
Luann Van Houten: Well, Marge, the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf sucks. He must have gotten that from your little boy, because they certainly don't say that word on TV!
Marge Simpson: Well, I can't defend everything he does. But let's face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They're too young for girls. And they're a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they're always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends!
Barney Gumble: So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me!

Homer Simpson: (SOBS) What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Barney Gumble: Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.

Krusty the Clown: Well, okay. First of all, my real name isn't Krusty the Clown, it's Hershel Krustofsky. My father was a rabbi. His father was a rabbi. His father's father -- well, you get the idea.
(Lower East Side of Springfield: ext. lower east side of Springfield - day)
Krusty the Clown: My father was the most respected man in the lower east side of Springfield. People would come from miles around to ask his advice.
Man #1: Reb Krustofsky, should I finish college?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Yes. No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge.
Woman: Rabbi, should I have another child?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Yes, another child would be a blessing on your house.
Man #2: Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Could you rephrase that as a, as a ethical question?
Man #2: (Struggling) Hmm... is it right to buy a Chrysler?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (MAKING A PRONOUNCEMENT) Yes, for great is the car with power steering and dyna-flow suspension.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson's house - at that moment)
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Hershel, life is not fun. Life is serious. Seltzer is for drinking, not for spraying. Pie is for noshing, not for throwing.
Krusty the Clown: But papa, can't...
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (INTERRUPTING) But nothing! You'll do as I say or you'll get such a zetz that you won't even know what hit you.
(Yeshiva Classroom: int. yeshiva classroom - day)
Krusty the Clown: Dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but the pull of clowning was too strong. I got my first big laughs at Yeshiva impersonating my father.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - DINING ROOM - night)
Homer Simpson: Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.
Bart Simpson: Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you.
Homer Simpson: Why you little...
Lisa Simpson: Krusty, please continue.
Krusty the Clown: Okay.
(Krustofsky Home: Int. KRUSTOFSKY home - evening)
Krusty the Clown: My father tried to extinguish the comedy bug. But it was no use.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: What are you doing in that bathroom?
Krusty the Clown: Go away.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Open the door this instant.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Oy gevalt!
Krusty the Clown: Close the door!
(GROSSINGERS: Int. grossingers - on stage - night)
Krusty the Clown: Then came my big break. A Talmudic conference in the Catskills and I was the entertainment.
Krusty the Clown: But the Lord works in mysterious ways.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Do you know that my son Hershel was first in his Yeshiva class. As a matter of fact, he was voted "The Most Likely to Hear God."
Rabbi #1: Oh go on, Hymie. You're exaggerating again. You're so proud of your son.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: A rabbi would never exaggerate. A rabbi composes; he creates thoughts; he tells stories that may never have happened, but he does not exaggerate.
Krusty the Clown: My father would have never have suspected a thing, were it not for one rowdy rabbi.
Rowdy Rabbi: Hey, Funny-man!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Hershel? Hershel! Oy vay iz mir!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (GRAVELY) I have no son!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: You have brought shame on our family. Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive. But, but-but this? I never want to see you again. You... you... clown!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - DINING ROOM - night)
Krusty the Clown: (PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER) And I haven't seen my father since.
Lisa Simpson: That is so sad.
Bart Simpson: Krusty, do you think about your father a lot?
Krusty the Clown: All the time. Except when I'm at the track. Then it's all business.
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS) Look at you, Bart.
Krusty the Clown: Oh, isn't that fun?
Krusty the Clown: Hey, whoa.
Krusty the Clown: Oh, the Fourth of July. I can't believe that little boy in the pictures is you, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, I've got a lot of fond memories.
Marge Simpson: Well, look at the time. Almost midnight.
Krusty the Clown: Do you have any yearbooks?
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED) No, that's it. You've seen everything.
Krusty the Clown: (CHANGING THE SUBJECT) So uh, Milhouse, know any knock-knock jokes?
Milhouse Van Houten: (CRYING) I want to go home.
Marge Simpson: Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home.
Homer Simpson: Gladly.
Krusty the Clown: Wow. The Concert For Bangladesh.
Bart Simpson: Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad.
Krusty the Clown: Don't worry about me, I'm a survivor.
Krusty the Clown: Hey, did I leave my keys inside?
Bart Simpson: No!

Krusty the Clown: (EMOTIONAL) Didn't Itchy Jr. look happy playing with his father? And didn't Scratchy Jr. look happy playing with his dad until they got run over by a thresher? Wasn't that a beautiful cartoon? (SOBBING) For the love of God, cut to a commercial.
Bart Simpson: Poor Krusty.
Lisa Simpson: A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
Bart Simpson: We've got to do something.
Lisa Simpson: (SERIOUS) Let's move.
(Rev. Lovejoy's Office: int. rev. lovejoy's office)
Bart Simpson: Reverend Lovejoy, we need you to help us find a rabbi.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (TAKEN ABACK) Well, um... before you make any rash decisions, let me just remind you that the church is changing to meet the needs of today's young Christians.
Lisa Simpson: No, no. We're not converting, we just want to find a Rabbi Krustofsky.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Rabbi Krustofsky? Why, I do a radio call-in show with him every Sunday night.
Bart Simpson: Really?
Lisa Simpson: I didn't know that.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Gee, I mention it in my sermon every week.
Bart Simpson: Oh, oh, that radio show.
Lisa Simpson: (COVERING) Oh yeah, it's all the kids talk about on Monday at school.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Oh, well. Why have a free T-shirt. You'll be the "coolest" kids on the playground.
Bart Simpson: We'll put them on later. Now can you give us the rabbi's address?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Oh sure thing. Let me just check my "Non-Christian" rolodex.

Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Oh, what can I do for you, my young friends?
Bart Simpson: We came to talk to you about your son.
D.J.: And in order to keep our broadcasting license, we devote Sunday night dead time to public service shows of limited appeal.
D.J.: In that spirit, we bring you "Gabbin' about God," sponsored by Ace Religion Supply where they say: "If we don't got it, it ain't holy."
D.J.: With us tonight, once again, our very own three wise men: Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Monsignor Kenneth Daley, and Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky.
D.J.: Okay, and our first caller is from Shelbyville Heights.
Caller: Yes, hi, with all the suffering and injustice in the world, do you ever wonder if God really exists?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: No.
MONSIGNOR DALEY: (IRISH BROGUE) Not for a second.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Not at all.

Bart Simpson: (OVER THE PHONE) Hello, my name's Dimitri. I'm a first time caller, long time listener.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - continuous)
Bart Simpson: My question is, "If a son defies his father, and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy, shouldn't the father forgive the son?"
(Radio Station: int. radio station - continuous)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I think so.
MONSIGNOR DALEY: Yes, of course.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (GOING CRAZY) No way. Absolutely not. Never! Never! Who screens these calls? Who's in charge here? There's nobody in charge. They leave a building without people watching it and anybody who wants can call any stupid person they please...
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - continuous)
Bart Simpson: (DETERMINED) Don't worry, Lis. I've got a plan that can't fail.

(Park: ext. park - day)
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Oh, the best charity is to give and not let other people know.
Rabbi #2: But what if your example encourages others to give?
Bart Simpson: Speaking of charity, Rabbi Krustofsky, don't you think it's time you forgave your son?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Don't you understand that my boy broke my heart? He turned his back on our traditions and our faith, and on me. Get out of here you little pisher!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - lisa's room)
Bart Simpson: Oy, this guy's tough.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, we're gonna have to out smart him.

Waitress: That's ham, sausage and bacon with a smidge of mayo...
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (SHOCKED) What?
Waitress: ... on white bread.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Listen, you tell Mr. Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning Jewish novelist, that I lost my appetite.

(TEMPLE HALLWAY: int. temple Hallway - later)
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: You I told to go away.
Bart Simpson: But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, "A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Yes.
Bart Simpson: Then doesn't your religion command you to make up with Krusty?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: But in Exodus, the fifth commandment says, "Honor thy Father and thy Mother." End of story.
(Springfield Library: int. springfield library - day)

Moe Szyslak: Eeww!
Bart Simpson: (HOARSE) Rabbi, did not a great man say, and I quote, "The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I've heard of persecution, but what they went through is ridiculous! But the great thing is after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it." End quote.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Ohh, I never heard the plight of my people phrased so eloquently. Who said that, Rabbi Hillel?
Bart Simpson: Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: It was Judah the Pious?
Bart Simpson: Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Mamonides?
Bart Simpson: Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Oh, I got it -- the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Bart Simpson: I'm afraid not, Rabbi. It's from "Yes, I Can" by Sammy Davis Jr. An entertainer like your son.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (GASPS) The candy man?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: If a performer can think that way, maybe I'm completely upside-down on this whole problem. (BECOMING EMOTIONAL) All the years of joy that I've lost. Why? Because of my stubborn ways.

"Vin Scully": The kick is up...it's looking good... the ball is turning into a fat bald guy...
Homer Simpson: (PAINED GRUNT)
"Vin Scully": ...and it's no good. And you know what we say everytime something strange happens: "It's good that Bart did that. It's very good...."
Krusty the Clown: (TIRED LAUGH) Well, we're still on. Three hundred and forty-six consecutive hours. And all because of one little boy who... (SHARP, ALMOST HYSTERICAL) who won't let me stop! (REGAINS CONTROL) Anyway... now let's go over and see if Sideshow Mel has any more of those legal, over-the-counter wake-up drugs of his.
Kids In Audience: Yayy!
Homer Simpson: Slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh.

(Marvin Monroe's Office: ext. marvin monroe's office - establishing)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: You like attention, don't you Bart?
Bart Simpson: Do I ever! (LAUGHS)
DR MONROE: Well we all do. The problem is that you don't care whether you get good attention, for say getting good marks in school, or bad attention for .. say.. turning your father into a Jack-in-the-box.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Homer, I see you agree with my theory.
Homer Simpson: (TIGHTLY) I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Well that's too bad because the attention the boy craves should be coming from you. I want you to spend some quality time with him. Get to know him. Maybe even love him.
Homer Simpson: Ouch! (BACK AND FORTH NOISES)
Homer Simpson: Good night, son.
Bart Simpson: Good night, dad. You know, these last few days have been really swell. I wish there was something I could do to repay you.

(SECRET PASSAGEWAY: int. secret passageway)
(Laboratory: int. laboratory)
C. Montgomery Burns: You know Smithers, I've always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. So I replaced the flesh -- which is weak -- with steel, which is strong. Behold, the greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat o' nine tails.
Waylon Smithers: (GASPS) How long till it's up and running, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: Keep your pants on, Smithers. First, we need... (OMINOUSLY) The human brain.

Homer Simpson: (MUTTERING TO HIMSELF) Sheesh. What a slave driver.
Waylon Smithers: What corpse should we unearth, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONSIDERING) I don't know. I feel like a kid in a candy store.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello! An open grave. Smithers, get him out quickly, the stench is overpowering.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, will you quit your complaining.
Waylon Smithers: What a minute, sir. That's Homer Simpson. He wasn't exactly a model employee.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, who is a model (GETTING AN IDEA) ... employee?
Waylon Smithers: Ehhh... Simpson will do just fine, sir.
Waylon Smithers: Did you hear that, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: No, I didn't. Who is it? Frankenstein? The Booger Man?
Waylon Smithers: It's the man in the bag, sir. I think he's alive.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh... bad corpse. Bad corpse. Stop scaring Smithers. (TO SMITHERS) Satisfied?
Waylon Smithers: Thank you, sir.

C. Montgomery Burns: Hel-lo. Look at me, I'm Davey Crockett. (CHUCKLES)
C. Montgomery Burns: Look, Smithers, a twitch... it's moving. It's alive! Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad... well who's mad now?! (LAUGHS MANIACLLY)

Lisa Simpson: Whayda ya know, she's right.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - homer's work station)
C. Montgomery Burns: It wasn't suppose to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty, not this abomination.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh Smithers, I was wrong to play god. Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with. Now, take out that brain and flush it down the toilet.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, his family might appreciate it if you returned the brain to his body.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, come on. It's 11:45.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right.
(Laboratory: int. laboratory - a little later)
Waylon Smithers: Sir, do you know what this means? He is alive.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh you're right, Smithers. I guess I owe you a coke.

C. Montgomery Burns: Ahhh!
Waylon Smithers: Run, sir!
C. Montgomery Burns: Every bone... shattered... organs... leaking vital fluids. Slight headache... loss of appetite. Smithers, I'm going to die.
Waylon Smithers: (SCARED) Sir, is there nothing I can do?

Bart Simpson: (OUT OF BREATH) Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab.
Homer Simpson: I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMS)
C. Montgomery Burns: Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.
Homer Simpson: I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!

Lisa Simpson: I called her. She's not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement.
Homer Simpson: Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed.
(Springfield Elementary School: int. springfield elementary - auditorium - night)

Marge Simpson: Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her.
Homer Simpson: (LONG PAINFUL MOAN) Okay.
Homer Simpson: Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie.
Marge Simpson: Homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you.
Homer Simpson: Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. (MAKES FLITTING GESTURES) No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for.
Marge Simpson: We can't afford to buy a pony.
Homer Simpson: (SAGELY) Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony.
Marge Simpson: That's ridiculous.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore.
Marge Simpson: That's no reason to buy a pony!
Homer Simpson: See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes.
Marge Simpson: Stick to the subject.
Homer Simpson: Ha ha, you love me.

Homer Simpson: (WAVES HER OFF) Homer sleep now.
Lisa Simpson: What's wrong with Dad?
Marge Simpson: He's just exhausted. Lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony?
Lisa Simpson: No.
Marge Simpson: Well, it's a lot. In fact, your father had to take a second job.
Bart Simpson: The poor guy. Where's he working?
Marge Simpson: The Kwik-E-Mart.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, I hope you realize that your father can't keep this up.
Lisa Simpson: You're gonna make me give up Princess?
Marge Simpson: Lisa, we can't make you give up that pony.
Bart Simpson: I can make her. (PUNCHES FIST) Just give me five minutes alone with her.
Marge Simpson: No, Bart. No one's going to make her. This is something Lisa has to decide for herself.
Lisa Simpson: All the years I've lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face.

Lisa Simpson: Dad, you don't have to do this.
Homer Simpson: (AS IF TO A CHILD) Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money...
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I understand the sacrifice you've made for me. That's why I gave up the pony.
Homer Simpson: You did?
(Lisa's Bedroom: INT. LISA's ROOM - Day)

Dr. Nick Riviera: Thank you, Troy. Hi, everybody.
Audience: Hi, Dr. Nick.
Dr. Nick Riviera: Troy, I've brought with me the gravestone of author and troubled soul Edgar Allan Poe.
Dr. Nick Riviera: Yes, but unfortunately, a century of neglect has turned this tombstone into a depressing eyesore.
Dr. Nick Riviera: Not so fast Troy! With one application of Spiffy, you'll think the body's still warm.
Homer Simpson: (ENTHRALLED) Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Dad, you got a power drill?
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED) In the garage.
Bart Simpson: Check.
Dr. Nick Riviera: I'm offering three bottles -- enough to clean one thousand tombstones -- for only thirty-nine ninety-five.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, give us a break, Doctor.
Dr. Nick Riviera: But Troy, how can I make it lower than thirty-nine ninety-five.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Homer, I can't find the safety goggles for the power saw.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED) If stuff starts flying, just turn your head.
Bart Simpson: Oh, check.
Dr. Nick Riviera: Okay. I'll throw in a fourth bottle, the applicator glove, and a state of Kansas Jell-O mold -- twenty-nine ninety-five.

Marge Simpson: Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again?
Homer Simpson: (COVERING PHONE) Shh! They'll hear you.
Marge Simpson: Who's using the power tools?
Homer Simpson: I don't know. Some guy I guess.
Marge Simpson: Well, we're going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I'm gone.
Homer Simpson: Oh sure, great idea. I'd love to -- (SEEING LISA; annoyed grunt) Did you hear that?
Lisa Simpson: Yes.
Homer Simpson: How much?
Lisa Simpson: Everything.
Homer Simpson: What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?
Lisa Simpson: Uh... take us to the video store.
Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Anything for my little girl.
Homer Simpson: Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. (TO HIMSELF) Stupid kid.

Homer Simpson: Ooooooh, McBain.
Scoey: Hey McBain, you keep eating them hot links and you'll never make it to a pension.
Scoey: No, thanks. Got me a future, partner. I'm two days away from retirement, my daughter's graduating from college --
Scoey: And as soon as we nail Mendoza my old lady and I are gonna sail around the world like we always wanted. We just christened the boat.
Scoey: Yes, sir, everything's gonna be just perf...
Scoey: Aw, damn, damn, damn. (WEAKLY) McBain...

Marge Simpson: (IRRITATED) I don't know.
Selma Bouvier: (RE MAGAZINE) Now Henry Winkler, there's a father. Listen to what he told a close friend. (READING) "I don't always keep my cool like `The Fonz', but my love for my kids has given me plenty of 'Happy Days'."

Football Announcer: (A LA JOHN FACENDA) ... They called him "The Galloping Gazelle." His habitat: the frozen tundra of Soldier Field. For six seasons and two pro bowls he grazed on the tasty green turf of the end zone. Until one fateful Sunday in November when the gazelle was stopped in his tracks by a big cat named Wayne Kychezski. (Pronounced "Sha-chef'-ski".)
Marge Simpson: Homie, we're back.
Selma Bouvier: Don't mind that clod, Patty. You could turn the world on with your smile.
Marge Simpson: Homer, could you turn off the TV? There's a little test I want you to take.
Homer Simpson: Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman.
Marge Simpson: This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
Homer Simpson: Oh Marge.
Marge Simpson: (READING) Question one: "Name one of your child's friends..."
Homer Simpson: Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets.
Marge Simpson: They want a name, Homer, not a vague description.
Homer Simpson: Okay. (GUESSING) Hank.
Marge Simpson: Hank?! Hank who?
Homer Simpson: Hank... Jones.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you made that up. Question two: "Who is your son's hero?"
Homer Simpson: Steve McQueen.
Marge Simpson: That's your hero. "Name another dad you talked to about parenting."
Homer Simpson: (IMMEDIATELY) Next.
Marge Simpson: "What are your son's hobbies?"
Homer Simpson: Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord.
Marge Simpson: He hasn't done that since he was two.
Homer Simpson: Then he has no hobbies.
Marge Simpson: (POINTED) Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see.
Homer Simpson: Bart!... BART!!!
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?
Bart Simpson: No, not really.
Homer Simpson: Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?
Bart Simpson: Building a Soap Box Derby racer.
Homer Simpson: (DISTRAUGHT) Oh, that's a hobby!
Bart Simpson: Hey, so it is.

Barney Gumble: Wow, it really is you.
Dave: Good Lord, a zero! (PRESSES INTERCOM) Lona, cancel my one o'clock. Mr. Simpson, we'll send a wood paneled station wagon over for you immediately.
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey Bart, where'd you get the lumber?
Bart Simpson: Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, "Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine."
Martin Prince: (SNOOTY) A conventional design.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin?
Martin Prince: (COYLY) In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've booked some time at the wind tunnel.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) Goodbye, son.
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey Bart, I think they're finally hauling your dad away.
Bart Simpson: Maybe it's for the best.
(NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE: EXT. NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE - AFTERNOON - establishing)
Dave: For starters, Mr. Simpson, won't you take this complimentary copy of "Fatherhood" by Bill Cosby.
Homer Simpson: Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold.
Dave: Mr. Simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son.
Homer Simpson: (TESTY) Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?
Dave: Why don't you ask him yourself?
Dave: Homer, meet Dave Jr.
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Dave: (TO DAVE JR.) How's your research coming, son?
DAVE JR.: I think we're near a breakthrough.
Dave: Good work.
DAVE JR.: Thanks, Dad.
Homer Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Oh, how I envy you!
Dave: Homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn't happen over night. It took years of effort.
Homer Simpson: (UPBEAT) I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
Dave: Aw, that's the spirit, Mr. Simpson. Now step one is to find an activity the two of you can share. Does the boy have any interests?
Homer Simpson: What boy?
Dave: Your son. Find something he likes to do and share in it.
Homer Simpson: (BRIGHTENING) Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer.
Dave: Aw, that would be perfect.
Dave: Dear God! Not again.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON house - GARAGE - DUSK)
Homer Simpson: Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.
Bart Simpson: Thanks, but I'm almost done. Why don't you get back on the couch and watch TV?
Homer Simpson: Okay. (BEAT) No, I'm gonna do it.
Bart Simpson: Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad's help.
Homer Simpson: But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.
Homer Simpson: (RE CRASHING) What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you.
Bart Simpson: Come on Dad, it'd be weird.
Homer Simpson: Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING, THEN) Hmm... (READING) "Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite." Huh?
Homer Simpson: Oh, that sounds too complicated.
Homer Simpson: All right, I will! (TO BART, STIFFLY) Son, I don't think you should let me help you.
Bart Simpson: Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes.
Homer Simpson: (ECSTATIC) Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!
Homer Simpson: You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit.
Marge Simpson: (PLEASED MURMUR)
(Springfield: EXT. SPRINGFIELD - SOAPBOX DERBY TRACK - DAY)
Homer Simpson: I like our chances, son.

Bart Simpson: Helmets are for wusses, Sir.
Official: I don't think I can let you go without a safety helmet.

Homer Simpson: Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS) It's over there, Nelson.
Nelson Muntz: Whoa, talk about your pieces of crap.
Martin Prince: (RE: NELSON) You know, Bart, I don't care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy.
Nelson Muntz: Careful, boys. It took me months to steal that bumper.
Voice From Trunk: (FAINT) Help! Help!
Bart Simpson: What was that?
Nelson Muntz: You didn't hear nothin'.
Homer Simpson: Are you nervous son?
Bart Simpson: Don't worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, "Gravity is my co-pilot."

Martin Prince: But that means I can't possibly race!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Son, you're lucky to be alive.
Martin Prince: Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor.
Bart Simpson: Is it okay to visit?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (CHUCKLES) Of course.
Bart Simpson: Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death.
Martin Prince: (GLUMLY) Thanks, Bart.
Bart Simpson: You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build 'em like you.
Martin Prince: (HOLDING UP HIS ARM IN A SLING) That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you. I'll never race again.
Bart Simpson: If you don't race, then Nelson'll win!
Martin Prince: Even if I wanted to, I'm in no shape to do it. Unless... Bart, will you drive my car?
Bart Simpson: Oh, I don't know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else's it'd kill him. On the other hand... I'll do it.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON house - GARAGE - LATER THAT DAY)
Homer Simpson: Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks...
Bart Simpson: Dad... I don't know how to say this, but I don't want to drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart...
Homer Simpson: Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson.
Bart Simpson: (DETERMINED) Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win.
Homer Simpson: When did I ever teach you that?
Bart Simpson: Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin's car I can win. I'm sorry, but...
Homer Simpson: (TURNING HIS BACK) Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad.
Homer Simpson: I'll just sit here in "Li'l Lightnin'" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son.
Homer Simpson: Ow.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert's office?
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED) Why? What's wrong?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there.
Homer Simpson: Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?

Homer Simpson: Sorry.
Marge Simpson: Don't you at least have something to say to Bart?
Homer Simpson: (FALSELY) No. Can't think of a thing.

Bart Simpson: Kill spectators.

Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Yeah, things are tough all over.
Moe Szyslak: Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.

Moe Szyslak: Uh, yeah, sure.
Moe Szyslak: Oh sorry, I forgot we're out of beer.
Homer Simpson: (sHRIEKS)

Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?
Patty Bouvier: (DRINKING A BEER) If you're going for a beer, this is the last one.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer Simpson: I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
Homer Simpson: In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.
Homer Simpson: It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.
Patty Bouvier: They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea, but Selma sank right to the bottom.
Homer Simpson: I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good.

Homer Simpson: Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?
Moe Szyslak: Uh, let me check the lost and found.
Moe Szyslak: What do we got here, Bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye...
Moe Szyslak: Oh. Here we are.
Moe Szyslak: It's not without its charm.
Homer Simpson: Try lighting it on fire.
Moe Szyslak: (SMILING) Whoa! Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.
Larry: Hey, your Love Tester's busted. I want my nickel back. (COUGHS)
Moe Szyslak: Hey, buddy. Have one on the house.
Larry: Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it?
Homer Simpson: Well, it's called a "Flaming...
Moe Szyslak: Moe! It's called a "Flaming Moe"! That's right, a "Flaming Moe". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That's why it's called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin' at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe I'm Moe.
Barney Gumble: Hey, what's this?
Moe Szyslak: A sneeze guard.
Barney Gumble: Wow, it really works.
HARV: (CHUCKLING) I'll be back.
Homer Simpson: Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?

Collette: You really expect me to tell you my measurements?
Moe Szyslak: You could, but I find this way is much more accurate... and fun.
Collette: (DISGUSTED) what do you offer in the way of salary?
Moe Szyslak: Minimum wage and tips. (MEANINGFULLY) Of course there are fringe benefits.
Collette: Such as?
Moe Szyslak: An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe.

Homer Simpson: Why yes I --
Moe Szyslak: (CUTTING HIM OFF) I'm your man.
HARV: Huh uh. My name is Harv Bannister. I work for "Tipsy McStagger's Good Time Drinking and Eating Emporium".
Moe Szyslak: Oh yeah? Hey, what's Mr. McStagger really like?
HARV: Actually, there is no Tipsy McStagger. He's just a composite of other successful logos.
Moe Szyslak: Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick.
HARV: (QUICKLY) Yes, fine, I will. Anyway, I've got a proposition for you.
Moe Szyslak: Keep talkin'.
HARV: We feel your "Flaming Moe" is perfect for our restaurant chain. We want to buy the recipe.
Moe Szyslak: No dice. The "Flaming Moe" is not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink?

Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Yes, everyone knows that.
Bart Simpson: It's not true! My father invented that drink, and if you'll allow me to demonstrate...
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (GASPS, THEN STERN) Bart, are those liquor bottles?

Waylon Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir. Sector Sieben-gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently terminated.
Homer Simpson: That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
Homer Simpson: (POINTED) Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes.
Homer Simpson: Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?

C. Montgomery Burns: (EVIL SMILE) Desperate, eh? (TO SMITHERS) Advantage, Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: This is my offer. I think you'll find it's most unfair, but those are the breaks.
Hans: But Mr. Burns, this is half of what we paid you.
C. Montgomery Burns: That's my final offer, take it or leave it.
Horst: (OMINOUS) All right, Mr. Burns. You win. But beware. We Germans aren't all smiles and sunshine.

C. Montgomery Burns: Restore my office. Cancel all repairs. And rehire that chap who sassed me in the bar.
Waylon Smithers: Homer Simpson, but why?
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers. I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer. He'll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by, blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head.

Homer Simpson: (DULLY) Yeah, what do you want?
Marge Simpson: (OVER INTERCOM) My husband by my side.
Homer Simpson: (AUTOMATICALLY) You want fries with that?
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Marge?
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Marge!
Homer Simpson: (LOOKS AT HER STOMACH) Holy cow, you're as big as a house.
Marge Simpson: Homer... Come home with me.
Homer Simpson: (ASHAMED) No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... (POINTING) They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring.
Marge Simpson: Any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
Homer Simpson: Marge, for you.
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aww...
Marge Simpson: Would you mind if I took it off now? The oil is burning my finger.
Homer Simpson: Oh, sure.
Marge Simpson: Homer, do you know why I married you?
Homer Simpson: Because I knocked you up?
Marge Simpson: No, because I love you.
Marge Simpson: Come home soon.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: ext. power plant - early morning)
C. Montgomery Burns: (ENTICING) That's it. That's it. Come closer...
C. Montgomery Burns: (LAUGHS) Ironic, isn't it. The hunter has become the hunted. (MANIACAL LAUGH) Oh God, Smithers, I feel so alive.
Homer Simpson: You the boss?
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes.
Waylon Smithers: I'll call security, sir.
Homer Simpson: (ROLLING UP SLEEVES) Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!
Homer Simpson: Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man. You can treat me like dirt and I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don't like it... I can change!!
C. Montgomery Burns: Hold the phone, Smithers... (TO HOMER) I like your attitude. Feisty yet spineless.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, this man not only failed the aptitude test, he got trapped in a closet on his way out.
C. Montgomery Burns: I don't care. I haven't been this impressed since I first laid eyes on a young boot-lick named Waylon Smithers.
Homer Simpson: You mean?
C. Montgomery Burns: (EXTENDS HAND) Welcome aboard, son.
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) I got the job. (YELLS) I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!
C. Montgomery Burns: Who was that young hellcat, Smithers?

(Hospital: INT. HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM - LATER)
Homer Simpson: Marge! Marge, where's the baby?

Homer Simpson: Shut up!
Patty Bouvier: Hey, listen fatboy --
Homer Simpson: No, you listen! This is my wife and this is my kid, and I'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!
Marge Simpson: Homer, does this mean --
Homer Simpson: Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (QUIETLY) Good God.
Homer Simpson: And tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back! Then I'm going house-hunting!
Marge Simpson: Doesn't your job start tomorrow?
Homer Simpson: Eh, somebody'll cover for me.
Marge Simpson: Homer, that's -- (LABOR PAIN) Ohh!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Uh, why don't you let me handle it, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Oh, college boy, eh?
Marge Simpson: Homer, for God's sakes, let him deliver the baby!
(Hospital Room: int. hospital room - later)
Marge Simpson: Homie, isn't he beautiful?
Homer Simpson: Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me.
Homer Simpson: Ahh, Bart. Daddy's little angel.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) Why you little... He did that on purpose!
Marge Simpson: How could he? He's only ten minutes old.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - living room - present day)
Homer Simpson: Bart, Lisa. Come here for a minute...
Homer Simpson: (WARMLY) Y'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have.
Homer Simpson: As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more.
Homer Simpson: And not a day goes by that we don't thank God for all three of you.

Homer Simpson: (MESMERIZED) Mon-ey.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars.
Homer Simpson: (OBLIVIOUS) Oh, sorry.
M.C.: That's very righteous. Funky C Funky Do will be back to lip sync another one of their hits, right after this.
TV Announcer: Hey kids! Why sit in front of the TV, when you can be on the radio!?
Boy: (SINGING) WE'RE GONNA ROLL THIS TRUCKIN' CONVOY / CROSS THE U.S.A. / CON-VOY...
Homer Simpson: That could be Bart!
TV Announcer: Throw away your bulky transmitters and broadcasting towers...
TV Announcer: The SuperStar celebrity microphone lets you hear your voice through any AM radio!
Teenager: Hey good lookin', we'll be back to pick you up later.
Homer Simpson: (ADMIRING WHISTLE) He's in for some lovin'.
TV Announcer: It's the perfect gift for birthdays, graduations, board meetings.
Executive: (ON MIC) You're fired!
Homer Simpson: Hm... Bart's birthday's coming up.

Homer Simpson: (GASPS) Limited?!
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE, URGENT) Do you have any of those microphones left?
(Warehouse: int. warehouse)
Operator: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, a couple.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Homer Simpson: Y'know, Marge. Bart's really gonna like my birthday present this year. It won't be like those shoe trees I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I'll buy his love yet.
Marge Simpson: (PLEASED MURMUR)
Krusty the Clown: Okay, Sideshow Mel, bring out the birthday cake!
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS) Hey kids, while Sideshow Mel mops up, let's see the names of our Krusty birthday pals for today!
Bart Simpson: All right! Here comes my name!
Bart Simpson: Wow, best eight bucks I ever spent.
Marge Simpson: Bart, your Grampa's on the phone. He wants to wish you a happy birthday.
Bart Simpson: Isn't that nice? Take a message. (HOLDS UP COUPONS) Right now I'm off to hit forty-six local merchants for free birthday goods and services.
(Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor: int. Phineas Q. Butterfat's - day)

Selma Bouvier: Mmm-hmm. We have one at home. Before we got it I was always finding Patty's stubble in my leg razor.
Bart Simpson: Ehhh...
Homer Simpson: Bart, I'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present!
Bart Simpson: (UNIMPRESSED) Next.
Marge Simpson: Bart! Be polite.
Bart Simpson: (FLAT) Next, please.
Martin Prince: Bart, I've noticed your birthday presents are a poor crop at best. I hope this turns the tide.
Patty Bouvier: Just gorgeous.
Martin Prince: (TO BART) Now we can be twins!
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING)
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) There's only one can of beer left and it's Bart's.
Homer Simpson: Hey boy, how's the microphone working?
Bart Simpson: Fine.
Homer Simpson: Bart! I would love to get a present like that.
Bart Simpson: Here you go. Enjoy.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Listen, boy, this is a great invention! Watch.
Homer Simpson: (SINGING) WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / ROCKIN' THROUGH THE NIGHT / WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / AIN'T SHE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT / CON-VOY
Lisa Simpson: Quit it, Dad!
Homer Simpson: Hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!
Marge Simpson: Wha'd you say? I can't understand you with all that distortion.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
(Bart's Bedroom: Int. Bart's room - later)
Bart Simpson: What a crappy birthday.
Bart Simpson: (EXPLODING) What do you mean, how did I get on the radio? I created the universe! Stupid kids.
Marge Simpson: Y'know Bart, I don't think this is such a bad present. Maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does.
Marge Simpson: (INTO MIC) Testing... testing... One, two, three... Oh, my. Do I sound like that?
Bart Simpson: (BRIGHTENING) Hey, it does work!
Marge Simpson: I bet you could have a lot of fun with this. Why don't you go show your father?
Bart Simpson: (IMPISHLY) Hmmm.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen)
Homer Simpson: Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer Simpson: Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream.
Marge Simpson: I'll get some at the store tomorrow, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Bart Simpson: People of Earth, this is Bartron, commander of the Martian invasion force. Your planet is in our hands. Resistance is useless.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
Bart Simpson: We have captured your president. He was delicious.
Homer Simpson: Why, you little...
Homer Simpson: (REALIZING) Wait a minute. Does this mean you like my present?
Bart Simpson: (CHOKING) Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson: Aww...
Homer Simpson: Just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes.
Bart Simpson: I promise.
Bart Simpson: (BABY VOICE) Mama! Mama!
Marge Simpson: Maggie! You talked! Can you say "mama" again?
Bart Simpson: (BABY VOICE) Sorry lady, show's over.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Bart.
Lisa Simpson: I dreamed I was married to Corey, and we lived on a pony farm...and Corey was always walking around with his shirt off.
Bart Simpson: Oh, brotherrr.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - BART'S CLASSROOM)
Bart Simpson: (MOCK HORROR) Mrs. Krabappel! That was uncalled for!
Milhouse Van Houten: Bravo!
Nelson Muntz: Well done, old man.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART'S ROOM - EVENING)
Bart Simpson: (MOCK DEEP VOICE) Rod... Todd... this is God.
Rod Flanders: How did you get on the radio?
Todd Flanders: (SCARED) Forgive my brother. We believe you.
Bart Simpson: Talk is cheap. Perhaps a test of thy faith. Walk through the wall. I will remove it for you...later.
Todd Flanders: What do you want from us?
Bart Simpson: I got a job for thee. Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen and leave them on the Simpsons porch.
Rod Flanders: But those cookies belong to our parents.
Bart Simpson: (EXASPERATED SIGH) Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?
Rod Flanders: Happy God.
Bart Simpson: Then quit flapping your lip and make with the cookies.
Todd Flanders: Yes, sir.
(Springfield Elementary School Back Field: EXT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BACK FIELD - DAY)
Bart Simpson: (WHISTLING)
Bart Simpson: Whoops!
Bart Simpson: Help! Help!
Groundskeeper Willie: Hoot mon! Sounds like trouble a-brewin' at the old well.
Bart Simpson: (PHONY VOICE) Help me, please! I fell down the well!
Groundskeeper Willie: I'll get help, laddie!
Groundskeeper Willie: (TO HIMSELF) A little nip of courage.
Groundskeeper Willie: (TO CARS) Out of my way! Look out, you horse's arse!
Bart Simpson: Sucker.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON)
Homer Simpson: Hey, what's up?
Jasper Beardly: Some fool kid fell down a well.
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Yes!
(Well: EXT. WELL - A LITTLE LATER)
Bart Simpson: My name is Timmy O'Toole. I just turned ten years old.
Dave Shutton: Timmy, where are your parents?
Bart Simpson: Uh... I have no family. I tried to enroll in school, but your Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes.
Seymour Skinner: He's a liar!
Crowd: (TO SKINNER) Booooooo!
Kent Brockman: The circumference of the well is thirty-four inches. So, unfortunately, not one member of our city's police force is slender enough to rescue the boy.
Chief Wiggum: By God, men -- you're a bunch of marshmallows!
Fat Cop: Why don't you go, Chief?
Chief Wiggum: (EMBARRASSED) I'm too... important.
Lisa Simpson: Is it Sherri?
Kent Brockman: Although the well is too dark to see the boy, Timmy has told us his foot is trapped under a rock. Thus, any attempt to pull him up would snap him like a twig.
Kent Brockman: In desperation, the city is considering more unorthodox solutions.
Falcon Man: Grasping the child firmly in his talons, Socrates here will fly him to safety! Just watch!
Falcon Man: I don't think he's coming back.
Sailor: With this hook, and this hunk of chocolate, I'll land your boy. And I'll clean him for free.
Professor Jonathan Frink: Although we can't reach your boy, we can freeze him with liquid nitrogen so that future generations can rescue him.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING)
Marge Simpson: Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little Timmy O'Toole, trapped in that well.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHS HEARTILY)
Marge Simpson: Bart! What's wrong with you?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero.
Lisa Simpson: How do you mean, dad?
Homer Simpson: Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out...
Lisa Simpson: How does that make him a hero?
Homer Simpson: Well, it's more than you did!
Kent Brockman: And finally, Channel Six's own Krusty the Clown has gathered members of the entertainment community -- who normally steer clear of fashionable causes -- for a video called "We're Sending Our Love Down The Well."
Krusty the Clown: I wanted to do something to help that boy. So I called my good friend Sting. He said, "Krusty, when do you need me?" I said Thursday -- he said, "I'm busy Thursday" -- I said, "What about Friday?" He said, "Friday's worse than Thursday." Then he said, "How about Saturday?" I said, "Fine." (BEAT) True story.
Sting: Yeah, I used to open for Krusty in uh, '69. In fact, he fired me as I recall.
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS WEAKLY) Sting.
Sting: But this isn't about show business. This is about some kid down a hole, or something, and we've all got to do what we can.
Sting: (SINGING) THERE'S A HOLE IN MY HEART / AS DEEP AS A WELL / FOR THAT POOR LITTLE BOY / WHO'S STUCK HALF-WAY TO HELL.
Sideshow Mel: (SINGING) THOUGH WE CAN'T GET HIM OUT / WE'LL DO THE NEXT BEST THING.
Groundskeeper Willie: Gas! Out of the hole!
Choir: (SINGING) AND WE'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL!
Krusty the Clown: (SINGS) ALL THE WAY DOWN.
Choir: (SING) WE'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL!
Krusty the Clown: (SINGS) DOWN THAT WELL!
Kent Brockman: Krusty, what are your plans for the royalties?
Krusty the Clown: Well, we gotta pay for promotion, shipping, distribution... you know, those limos out back -- they aren't free... Whatever's left, we throw down the well.
(Well: EXT. WELL - NIGHT)
Souvenir Hawker: Authentic Timmy O'Toole baby teeth! Six dollars a bag!
Bernard: Step to the rear... plenty of room in the back.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON)
Lisa Simpson: (CHUCKLES, THEN) Awww.
Bart Simpson: Drop that microphone! Drop it, boy!
Station Announcer: This is a special report from Channel Six news.
Kent Brockman: Disturbing news from the old town well, where young Timmy O'Toole has apparently taken a turn for the worse.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: I... a, it's very simple, Kent. The child is reverting to a feral, or wolf-like, state. Here's an artist's conception.
Lisa Simpson: (WHISPERS) Bart!
Bart Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT) I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn't get through my sock. (SEES LISA) Goodnight everybody. (SNORES)
Lisa Simpson: Bart Simpson! The thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. When they find out you've been fooling them, they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors.
Bart Simpson: Oh yeah? And how are they gonna find out?
Lisa Simpson: The police will catch you sooner or later.
Bart Simpson: The police. (SNORTS) They couldn't catch a cold.
Lisa Simpson: Maybe not, but I bet you're stupid enough to have left a "Property of Bart Simpson" label on that radio.
Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(Well: EXT. WELL - NIGHT)
Lou: And Cinderella had the most beautiful gown at the ball. With eight satin petticoats, each more delicate than the last. (BEAT) I think he's asleep.
Eddie: Want to get a cup of coffee?
Lou: Okay. (POINTING TO WELL) Brave little guy.
Eddie: Hey, I almost tripped over this thing.
Bart Simpson: (DEATH SCREAM)
Bart Simpson: (MOANS) What did I do to deserve this?
Bart Simpson: (SHOUTING) Help! Help! I fell down the well.
Eddie: Tell us something we don't know.
Bart Simpson: No! My name is Bart Simpson!
Lou: What are you doing down there?
Bart Simpson: (THINKING A BEAT) Look, I'll level with you. There is no Timmy O'Toole. It was just a prank I was playing on everybody.
Lou: (MAD) Well, you sure fooled us, kid.
Eddie: Hey, I got an idea for a prank. Let's go home and go to sleep. (CHUCKLE).
Lou: Good one, Eddie.
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS LAUGH) Great joke, guys. Ha ha. Ha. (BEAT) Guys?
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - next day)
Lou: So I'm afraid your son is trapped down the well.
Homer Simpson: You must think we're the worst parents in the world.
Eddie: Yeah, that's... pretty much the feeling down at the station.
(Well: ext. well - a little later)
Homer Simpson: (SOOTHING) Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll...
Bart Simpson: Ow! Knock it off you bald boob!
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) Hey, don't make me come down there!
Bart Simpson: Like to see you fit.
Homer Simpson: Why, you little --
Mayor Joe Quimby: Put a man on him.
Old Lady #1: I liked the other boy. So polite.
Marge Simpson: (DISTRAUGHT) What are you doing to save my baby boy?
Chief Wiggum: Uh well, ma'am, we've located a piece of machinery in Shreveport, Louisiana, that could pop him out lickety-split.
Marge Simpson: Well, why don't you get it?
Chief Wiggum: Well, I'm afraid we've got a budget problem, Mrs. Simpson. Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well. Had he done it at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo.
Marge Simpson: You're telling me that the city won't pay to get a boy out of a well?
Chief Wiggum: Well, they would have for Timmy. People loved that little guy. But your son, well, he kinda played us all for a bunch of saps.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Gentlemen, this canary died of natural causes.
Groundskeeper Willie: Back in the hole!
Bart Simpson: (DISGUSTED) No!
Kent Brockman: So it seems we've all been the victims of a cruel hoax, perpetrated by a ten-year-old-hooligan. The time has come for finger-pointing. And most of them are squarely aimed at the boy's parents.
Homer Simpson: It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Uh, could you edit that last part out?
Kent Brockman: Mr. Simpson, we're live coast-to-coast.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Wanda: One plus one plus three is five/ Little Bart Simpson's buried alive / He's so neat / He's so sweet / Now the rats have Bart to eat.
Lisa Simpson: Hey, stop that!
JANEY: Sorry, Lisa.
JANEY: How many days until Bart croaks. (SPINNING FASTER) One, two, three, four...
D.J.: (CASEY KASEM VOICE) And our new number one hit, "I Do Believe We're Naked", by Funky C Funky Do, replaces "We're Sending Our Love Down The Well", which plunges all the way down to number ninety-seven.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Ever since I've called for the rescue of that Simpson lad, I 'Have taken a lot of heat. So, I am flip-flopping. I say, "Let him stay down there!"
Dave Shutton: Yeah, Shutton here. (LISTENS) Now that's a story!
Marge Simpson: Bart? Honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're down in the well.
Bart Simpson: Mom, it's too big.
Homer Simpson: Don't worry, you'll grow into it.
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) Homer!
Bart Simpson: You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. I guess now I'm paying the price. But there's so many things I'll never get a chance to do. Smoke a cigarette, use a fake I.D., shave a swear word in my hair...
Homer Simpson: That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself.
Groundskeeper Willie: Now, why didn't I think of that?
Groundskeeper Willie: (to shovel) Agnes, we've got work to do.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Kent Brockman: (GRIM) This is Kent Brockman with a special bulletin. The Lincoln Squirrel has been assassinated. We'll stay with the story all night if we have to.
Lisa Simpson: What's going on?
Jasper Beardly: It's an old fashioned hole diggin'. By gar, it's been a while.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (GASP) The canary!
Marge Simpson: Sting, you look tired. Maybe you should take a rest.
Sting: Not while one of my fans needs me.
Marge Simpson: Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums--
Homer Simpson: (TO MARGE) Shh! Marge, he's a good digger.
Bart Simpson: Sting!
Bart Simpson: Mom! Dad!
Marge Simpson: Oh Bart, I've missed you so much.
Bart Simpson: Man, I was so scared.
Homer Simpson: (SMILING) Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again.
(Well: ext. well - sunset)
Groundskeeper Willie: That should do it.
Bret: Hey everybody, Bret Gunsilman here in pivotal week three of the NFL on Fox.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON house - LIVING ROOM - continuous)
Bret: Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action.
Homer Simpson: Well, bye-bye belt.
Marge Simpson: Homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart.
Homer Simpson: Pfft, my heart is just fine.
Homer Simpson: A little beer will put out that fire.
Bret: And now with his picks for today's games, the man who's right fifty-two percent of the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo.
JIMMY: Thank you, Bret. Our first game today -- Denver and New England -- is too close to call.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
JIMMY: But if you're one of those compulsive types who just has to bet -- well, I don't know... uh... Denver.
Homer Simpson: Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!
(Moe's Tavern: int. Moe's tavern - day)
Moe Szyslak: Moe's Tavern. Where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.
Homer Simpson: Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver.
Moe Szyslak: (SLYLY) I think I can provide that service. (LOOKING AROUND) Um, uh, Chief Wiggum, could you hand me that little black book?
Chief Wiggum: Oh, sure thing, Moe. I was just using it as a coaster.
Homer Simpson: Twenty big ones on Denver.
Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Pleasure doing business with you, (COYLY) H. S.
Homer Simpson: (TO TV) All right, Denver. Justify my love.
Lisa Simpson: I don't know, the Dolphins.
Football Announcer: At the end of thirteen seconds of play, it's New England seven, Denver nothing.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Lisa Simpson: Look, Dad. I made a modest studio apartment for my Malibu Stacey doll. This is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter...
Lisa Simpson: DAAAAAD! You're not listening to me.
Homer Simpson: (GRUMBLING) Lousy, stupid Denver.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - Kitchen - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Oh, look at that, a shoe box house. Lisa, you're so clever.
Lisa Simpson: Why isn't Dad ever interested in anything I do?
Marge Simpson: Well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does?
Lisa Simpson: No.... well, we used to have burping contests, but I outgrew it.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, well, if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap. I do it all the time. I pretend I'm interested in looking at power tools, going to those silly car chase movies, and... some things I'll tell you about when you're older. Do you understand?
Lisa Simpson: I think so.
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Whaaat?
Announcer: Ho, look at that score. Moxy!
Homer Simpson: Why did you do that?
Lisa Simpson: (HOPEFULLY) Wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
Homer Simpson: (EXASPERATED SIGH) Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there.
Homer Simpson: Over.
Homer Simpson: Over... over... over...
Homer Simpson: Lisa, please, I can't hear the announcer.
Lisa Simpson: He said Denver just fumbled.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Bart Simpson: (NORMAL VOICE) See you in Hell, soldier boy! (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: Bart?
Bart Simpson: Yeah mom?
Marge Simpson: I was thinking that while your father and Lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping.
Bart Simpson: Mom, I'd love to. But to be honest, I don't need new clothes.
Marge Simpson: Oh really?
Marge Simpson: (DISAPPROVING) Hmm...
Bart Simpson: So even though I'd love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes. It's not...
JIMMY: (CHUCKLING) Well folks, when you're right fifty-two percent of the time, you're wrong forty-eight percent of the time.
Homer Simpson: (FURIOUS) Why didn't you say that before!
Bret: (CHUCKLING) Okay, Jimmy, you're off the hook. We've got Miami Cincinnati coming up. Any thoughts?
JIMMY: I certainly do, Brett. I hereby declare Miami to be Smooth Jimmy's "Lock of the Week."
Homer Simpson: Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy.
Sportscaster: In the Cincinnati - Miami game, I declare Cincinnati to be my "Shoe-in of the Week".
Homer Simpson: Huh, they both make a good case.
Professor Jonathan Frink: After evaluating millions of pieces of data in the blink of an eye, the Gambletron 2000 says the winner is... (READING A PRINTOUT) Cincinnati by two hundred points?! Why you worthless hunk of junk!
Coach: (FAST) You want some of this don't ya?
Homer Simpson: Yeah!

Coach: ...is blowing out of the west...
Homer Simpson: Oh...
Coach: at five
Homer Simpson: ... miles per hour.
Coach: knots...
Homer Simpson: (PANICKED) Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?
Homer Simpson: Good, good. (DIALING PHONE) Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins.
Moe Szyslak: Gotcha, fifty beans on Miami. Um, Homer, I got a call on the other line. (TAPS PHONE) Hello?

Bart Simpson: Fine, get it. Lets go.
Marge Simpson: No, no, no, you have to try it on.
Marge Simpson: Oooh, and this one's fifty percent off.
Bart Simpson: You know why these clothes are on sale, Mom? Because the people who wear them get beaten up.
Marge Simpson: Well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend. Ooh this looks good.... oh and this one is very, very cute... (PILING ON MORE CLOTHES) And these... (BEAT) Oh look! Little bow ties.
Marge Simpson: And don't make that face at me.

Homer Simpson: Whoo-hoo!
Lisa Simpson: Whoo-hoo!
Homer Simpson: Fifty big ones!
Lisa Simpson: (PUZZLED) Fifty big ones?
Homer Simpson: Uh-oh. (STUCK) You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game.
Lisa Simpson: You mean you made a bet?
Homer Simpson: Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting.
Lisa Simpson: What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
Homer Simpson: Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?
Lisa Simpson: Uh-huh.
Marge Simpson: See how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
Homer Simpson: And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream (GETTING ENGROSSED) and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things...
Lisa Simpson: So gambling makes a good thing even better.

Football Announcer #2: And the final from Riverfront Stadium, Miami 24 -- Cincinnati 10.
Homer Simpson: YEAH!
Lisa Simpson: Boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars.
Homer Simpson: You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible.
Lisa Simpson: Really, where?
Homer Simpson: Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?
Lisa Simpson: Okay, dad.
Marge Simpson: Did you two have fun?
Homer Simpson: (COYLY) You bet.
Marge Simpson: Well, we had fun too. Right now, Bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: You gotta come out sometime, Simpson.
Lisa Simpson: Goodnight, Dad. I had a really nice time today.
Homer Simpson: Me too, honey.

Homer Simpson: All right!
Lisa Simpson: He'll lose.
Homer Simpson: What? Didn't you hear what he said?
Lisa Simpson: Look at the fear in his eyes. Listen to the quiver in his voice. He's a little boy, lost in a game of men.
Homer Simpson: You think we should bet against them?
Lisa Simpson: I'd bet my entire college fund on it.
Homer Simpson: You got it.
Homer Simpson: Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York.
Football Announcer: Start spreadin' the news, it's New York over Philadelphia, thirty-five to ten.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I'm getting nauseous.
Homer Simpson: (PUTTING HER DOWN) Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games?
Lisa Simpson: Well, I like the 49ers because they're pure of heart -- Seattle because they got something to prove -- and the Raiders because they always cheat.
Football Announcer: And in an extremely suspicious play, the Raiders win.
Lisa Simpson: (CHEER)

Homer Simpson: My daughter, that's who!
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, me!
Homer Simpson: Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift.
Lisa Simpson: C'mon, dad. It doesn't take a genius to realize that Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game.
Homer Simpson: Oh, my little girl says the cutest things.
Lisa Simpson: (HAPPILY) You know, dad, Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week.

Lisa Simpson: Mom, can't a man do something nice for his loved ones?

JIMMY: (SMOOTH) He doesn't look too happy.
Bret: (CHUCKLES) Well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he's slowly suffocating. Still, that is a real fan.
Homer Simpson: Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks.
Homer Simpson: You promised you wouldn't get mad!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I'm making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. And with your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago.
Homer Simpson: Good, good... You call Moe.

Lisa Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT) The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago. I was sitting on my daddy's knee when the Saints, who were four and a half point favorites, but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second, to cover the spread.
Miss Hoover: Dear God!

Homer Simpson: Boy, I know you're gonna like your present.
Box: (MECHANICAL VOICE) Shut up. Shut up. Kiss my butt. Shut up. Go to Hell. Go to Hell.
Bart Simpson: Dad, I promise you I will never get tired of this.
Marge Simpson: Homer, those are very thoughtful presents. But you have to tell me where you got the money from.
Homer Simpson: (TRAPPED) All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad.
Marge Simpson: I promise I will get mad, because I always do when you make me promise I won't.
Homer Simpson: All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Marge Simpson: I did not! I promised I would get mad! She's an eight-year-old girl.
Homer Simpson: But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?
Marge Simpson: But gambling is illegal.
Homer Simpson: Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together.
Marge Simpson: Well, I just don't know.
Homer Simpson: Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted.
Homer Simpson: Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this.
Lisa Simpson: You know, dad, we've been watching a lot of TV lately. Maybe, the Sunday after the Super Bowl, we could hike up to the top of Mount Springfield. The fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets.
Homer Simpson: Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney.
Lisa Simpson: (SHOCKED) What about Daddy-Daughter day?
Homer Simpson: Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away.
Lisa Simpson: So that's it. You just wanted me to help you gamble. You never wanted to be with me at all.

Homer Simpson: Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat.
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Lisa Simpson: So you've come to buy my forgiveness. Sorry, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, I did.
Homer Simpson: Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh? (CHUCKLES)
Lisa Simpson: (WARMING) Well, I would like to see what all the fuss is about.
Homer Simpson: It's a date! (SLYLY) So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread?
Lisa Simpson: (GOES COLD) Put me down.
Lisa Simpson: Look dad, I'll tell you who's gonna win the Super Bowl if you want me to. But it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me.
Homer Simpson: (THINKS A BEAT) Okay.
Lisa Simpson: I think Dallas is a mortal lock.
Homer Simpson: Dallas! Whoo-hoo!
Lisa Simpson: However...
Homer Simpson: (FRANTIC) However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?
Lisa Simpson: However, I may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously I want you to lose. In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: "Daddy should bet all his money on..."

Bret: Could be another Drexel's Class. Ooh, looks like we're almost ready for the kickoff.

Homer Simpson: Ohh, you son-of-a.
Ned Flanders: Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial.
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal.
Homer Simpson: You dirty bas...
Homer Simpson: What do ya think, Lisa?
Lisa Simpson: How's the dog supposed to get in?

(Springfield Elementary School: int. springfield elementary - bart's classroom - day)

Bart Simpson: What's wrong with Principal Skinner?

Bart Simpson: (GUILTY MOAN)
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - backyard - day)
Homer Simpson: (CALMLY) Oh fudge, that's broken.
Homer Simpson: (CALMLY) Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse.
Homer Simpson: Where'd you get the money?
Marge Simpson: There was more than enough in the swear jar. (COY) And if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise.

Bart Simpson: Mrs. Krabappel.
Homer Simpson: (WHISTLES) Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night. (GROWL)
Marge Simpson: Homer! Bart, you did a very cruel thing.
Homer Simpson: Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth.
Marge Simpson: No, Homer. The truth would humiliate her.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear.
Lisa Simpson: Maybe we should write her another letter. One that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
Homer Simpson: Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty.
Homer Simpson: "Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you."
Marge Simpson: (GENTLY) We'll all help.
Lisa Simpson: "Though I'll be inoculating babies in Kampuchea, my heart will always be with you."
Bart Simpson: That sucks. How 'bout, "Crocodiles bit off my face."
Marge Simpson: That's disgusting. And besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face.
Homer Simpson: I may hold you to that, Marge.
Lisa Simpson: "Okay, okay... I cannot see you for the next five years, for I will be farming the ocean floor."

Homer Simpson: It's something very special. A home-made bat. (TELLING STORY) It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house...
Homer Simpson: Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find.
Homer Simpson: Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of.
Homer Simpson: I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
Marge Simpson: Homie, come to bed.
Marge Simpson: Homer, go back to the garage.

ARI: Would you care to bet a million dollars on that?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting?
ARI: (PUZZLED) What? A million dollars isn't interesting to you?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, did you say a million? I'm... I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere. I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would bait each other and... well, you know how it goes. Yes... certainly, a million will be fine.
C. Montgomery Burns: Um-hm.
(Burns's Office: int. burns' office)
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, I've been thinking. Is it wrong to cheat in order to win a million dollar bet?

Waylon Smithers: No, sir! Whom should I kill?
Homer Simpson: I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry!
C. Montgomery Burns: No, Smithers. I've decided to bring in a few ringers. Professional baseballers.
C. Montgomery Burns: We'll give them token jobs at the plant and have them play on our softball team. Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown...
Waylon Smithers: Uh... sir...
C. Montgomery Burns: What is it, Smithers?
Waylon Smithers: I'm afraid... all those players have retired and... uh... passed on. In fact, your right fielder has been dead for a hundred and thirty years.

Homer Simpson: Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.
Bart Simpson: You make me sick Homer. You're the one who told me I could do anything if I just put my mind to it.

Waylon Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Or Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: Secondly, instead of beer, from now on you will all be drinking this!

Waylon Smithers: (SHOCKED) What?
Darryl Strawberry: You're pinch-hitting for me?
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes. You see, you're a left-hander. And so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it's called playing the percentages. It's what smart managers do to win ballgames.
Darryl Strawberry: But I've got nine home runs today.

Kent Brockman: But there's already one big winner. Our state's school system, which gets fully half the profits from the lottery.
Marge Simpson: You can still win some money if you have five out of six.
Homer Simpson: Whoo-hoo!
Seymour Skinner: Just think what we can buy with that money. (DREAMILY) History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don't have that Base six crap in them.

Lisa Simpson: (GASP)
Bart Simpson: Grampa, he's not dead!
Homer Simpson: Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not.
Lisa Simpson: It's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that.
Grampa Simpson: He is dead! I'll get a shovel.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED) Well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick.
Grampa Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) Oh, sure! The old man's off his rocker. If Grampa says he's dead he must be alive.
Lisa Simpson: He is alive. He's wagging his tail.
Grampa Simpson: (FLUSTERED. TRYING TO DEFEND HIS POSITION) That don't mean nothin'! Dogs wag their tails for hours after they die. I'm tired of this conversation. Let's talk about something else. I'm going home.

(Animal Hospital: INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - VET'S OFFICE)
Vet: Clear! Ugh... Clear!
Nurse: Doctor... he's gone.
Vet: (SIGHS) This is the part of the job I hate.
Homer Simpson: Hey, you did the best you could.
Vet: I love animals. I spend my life saving them and they can't thank me. Well... the parrots can -- but, anyway let's see what's wrong with this little fella.
Vet: I'm afraid that your dog has a twisted stomach. He needs an operation to correct it or he'll die.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Marge Simpson: Hmm, how much will it cost?
Vet: Seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Marge Simpson: Oh dear!
Vet: This is never an easy decision. It's an awful lot of money.
Homer Simpson: Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over.
Bart Simpson: Talk what over? What's there to talk about?
Bart Simpson: What are we going to talk over?
Krusty the Clown: (TO RECEPTIONIST) Mr. Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - a little later)
Bart Simpson: I can't help but notice we're leaving the hospital. When's the dog going to get his operation?
Homer Simpson: Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen)
Homer Simpson: In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and...
Bart Simpson: Is there a Doggie Hell?
Homer Simpson: Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
Bart Simpson: Who's in there?
Homer Simpson: Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester.
Lisa Simpson: Checkers.
Homer Simpson: Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.
Bart Simpson: (SUSPICIOUSLY) Hey! Wait a minute, does this have anything to do with Santa's Little Helper?
Marge Simpson: Oh, honey. Seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. We really can't afford this operation.
Bart Simpson: You're gonna just let him die?
Marge Simpson: I know you're upset --
Bart Simpson: Darn right I'm upset!
Marge Simpson: Bart, watch your language. (THINKS) Oh. You did. Sorry.
Bart Simpson: We are not going to let our dog die! And that's IT! (UNDER BREATH) Lousy dog-killing sonsa...
Homer Simpson: But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
Homer Simpson: (TO DOG) Oh, come on! (FIRMLY) I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. (WHINES) Marge, make him stop.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks, Mom.
Homer Simpson: All right. All right. We'll find a way. (MUMBLES) Lousy manipulative dog.
(Burns's Office: int. burns' office)
Homer Simpson: Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
C. Montgomery Burns: Please, do go on...
Homer Simpson: I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, please, continue...
Homer Simpson: I thought maybe you...
Homer Simpson: (SEEING GUARDS) Oh. (TO BURNS) Well, thanks for your time.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SHAKES HEAD) What makes a man endanger his job, and yes, even his life, by asking me for money?
Waylon Smithers: People like dogs, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?
Waylon Smithers: Uh... if YOU did it, sir?...
C. Montgomery Burns: (NOT LISTENING) Exactly! You'd be fit to be tied! (CONTEMPT) Dogs!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - evening)
Marge Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: What?
Marge Simpson: You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself.
Homer Simpson: But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
Homer Simpson: Maybe you're right, Marge.
Marge Simpson: I've found a way we can pay for the operation.
Homer Simpson: (HAPPY) Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?
Marge Simpson: No. I'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. Homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while.
Marge Simpson: Bart, from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at Springfield Barber College.
Bart Simpson: No problemo.
Marge Simpson: I'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and I found a way to stretch the food budget. Fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. Ham night will be Spam night. And porkchop night...
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
Marge Simpson: ... will now be chub night.
Homer Simpson: (TO SELF) Chub? I don't even know what that is!
Marge Simpson: Lisa, I'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of Encyclopedia Generica from the grocery store.
Lisa Simpson: (DISTRAUGHT) But, Mom, next week is volume four: Copernicus through Elephantiasis.
Marge Simpson: We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer...
Homer Simpson: Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats...
Marge Simpson: I don't think you've thought this through.
(Animal Hospital: int. animal hospital - waiting room)
Nurse: Good news, Mr. Danielson, we saved your gamecock. But I'm afraid he'll never fight again.

God: Come to the light, boy. (WHISTLES) Come into the light. Come on now. There's a good boy. Come on. Come on.
Nurse: Um... Simpson?
Vet: It's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of dental school.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - establishing)
Homer Simpson: Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?
Marge Simpson: You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly just snouts and entrails.
Homer Simpson: Mmm... snouts.
Kent Brockman: Yes, I'm back. Kent Brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. Hey, I'm a journalist.
Homer Simpson: (MUTTERING) Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy.
Marge Simpson: What's that?
Homer Simpson: (THINKS, THEN:) A dinosaur.
Kent Brockman: Of course I'm not the only one who benefited from last week's big payoff. Our state's schools got their share too. Here, lottery officials present Springfield Elementary with a brand new eraser.
Seymour Skinner: (BITTER) One eraser? Oh, I'm used to my government betraying me. I was in Nam. I served for three --
Kent Brockman: And speaking of lotteries, here are the winning numbers for this week's forty-thousand dollar (CONDESCENDING) "jackpot": 3 - 6 - 17 - 18 - 22 and 29.
Marge Simpson: Oh no! Those are my numbers! If it wasn't for that dog, I would've won!

Young Barfly: Who's that old rummy?
Moe Szyslak: (OFFENDED) Before his dog got sick, that "old rummy" used to be my best customer.

Marge Simpson: (TO SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER) Not now.
Lisa Simpson: (BITTER) Can't you see I'm reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station?
Bart Simpson: Dumb dog.
Marge Simpson: Homie, did you close the gate?
Homer Simpson: (SLEEPY) Yes.
Homer Simpson: (COVERING) Oh, you mean tonight.
Marge Simpson: The dog will get out!
Homer Simpson: (YELLING) Bart! Close the gate.
Bart Simpson: (SLEEPILY) Lisa! Close the gate.
Lisa Simpson: (YAWNS) Close the gate, Maggie.
Marge Simpson: (CALLING) Here boy!
Bart Simpson: (WHISTLES)
Lisa Simpson: (CALLING) Here Santa's Little Helper!

Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
C. Montgomery Burns: (SOTTO) Release the hounds. (TO FLANDERS) Well, neighbor I see you've got your running shoes on. That's a good thing.
C. Montgomery Burns: What's wrong with Crippler?
Waylon Smithers: He's getting on, sir. He's been here since the late sixties.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah yes, I'll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie. That young man didn't think it was too "groovy." (CHUCKLES)
(Dog Pound: int. dog pound)
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm looking for something in an attack dog. One who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why here's the fellow! Wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. Reminds me of me.
Homer Simpson: Uh...the last one.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now! As an attack dog, you'll be expected to neutralize intruders.
Waylon Smithers: Wanna buy some cookies? Wanna buy some cookies?
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISGUSTED) If that were a real Girl Scout I'd have been bothered by now.
Barney Gumble: I know how you feel, I lost my dog too. (LOOKS IN HOUSE) He's in here somewhere.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now here's a film that will turn you into a vicious souless killer. Enjoy.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Lisa Simpson: Poor Santa's Little Helper. I'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
Homer Simpson: (TEARY) That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug.
Marge Simpson: (EYEING KIDS) Homer get a-hold of yourself. Even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. Remember Doggie Heaven.
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING) Oh, Marge! There is no such place!
Homer Simpson: Or... to put it another way... there is.
Bart Simpson: I'm not giving up. I don't care if I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. I'm gonna find my dog.

Bart Simpson: Gee, I'm sorry mister.
Butler: (TO KENT) Sir, your llama just bit Ted Kennedy.
Kent Brockman: Good.

(Car: int. car - after movie)

Marge Simpson: Has she kissed you?
Homer Simpson: A coupla times.
Marge Simpson: I want you to stop seeing her.
Homer Simpson: I can't. I'm her manager.
Marge Simpson: Her manager? That's ridiculous. I won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer.
Marge Simpson: Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. And you did it at the county fair last year. Remember?

Lurleen Lumpkin: (SINGS) THAT'S RIGHT! I FINALLY BAGGED ME A HOMER.
Mr. Boylan: Lurleen, we're gonna have to cut you off. We're getting some kind of grinding noise on the track.
Homer Simpson: (SNAPPING FINGERS) You, off the bench.
(Lurleen's Trailer: int. lurleen's trailer - night)
Homer Simpson: Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV.
Lurleen Lumpkin: Oh Homer! You're as smart as you are handsome.
Homer Simpson: (OFFENDED) Hey! (BEAT) Oh, you meant that as a compliment. (THEN) Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new.
Lurleen Lumpkin: (SUGGESTIVELY) Well, I have been working on something that could really heat things up.

Lurleen Lumpkin: (SIGHS)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - afternoon)
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) All our money's tied up in this woman. If she fails, we're broke. If she succeeds, I have no husband. I don't know what to root for.
Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) You don't?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) I gotta go. (HANGS UP) Homer...
Homer Simpson: Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight. I gotta get ready.
Marge Simpson: Just so you know, while you and Lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, Maggie cut her first tooth.
Homer Simpson: (ABSENTLY) That's great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?
Marge Simpson: You're not even listening to me!
Homer Simpson: (NOT LISTENING) Sure they will.
Marge Simpson: Kids, will you come in here?
Marge Simpson: You've got a wonderful family, Homer. Please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight.
Homer Simpson: Uh... I gotta go.
Bart Simpson: As much as I hate that man right now, you gotta love that suit.

Lurleen Lumpkin: (SINGS) OH THE BASES WERE EMPTY...
Executive: Excuse me, are you Colonel Homer Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Yes I am.
Executive: I'm from Rebel Yell Records, a division of Togasaki Corp. I'm interested in buying Lurleen's contract.
Homer Simpson: Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy.
(LURLEEN'S DRESSING ROOM: int. lurleen's dressing room - a little later)
Homer Simpson: Lurleen, they loved you.
Lurleen Lumpkin: Well thank you -- I'm still a little itchy from that fiberglass hay.
Homer Simpson: Is there anything you need?
Lisa Simpson: (MOCK INNOCENCE) I'm sorry?
Lurleen Lumpkin: Well... you could make my evening complete.
Lurleen Lumpkin: What's wrong?
Homer Simpson: My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
Young Girl: Gross!
Girl: (MUFFLED) Thanks for dinner!
Pretty Girl: No!
Homer Simpson: At least could I have my dollar ba...
Marge Simpson: I'll love you for the rest of my life.
Homer Simpson: I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family.
Homer Simpson: Just so I don't wonder... You would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?
Lurleen Lumpkin: Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson: (SIGHS, PAINED) Okay.
Homer Simpson: Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen. And I'll take any offer.
Executive: I'll give you fifty bucks.
Homer Simpson: You son of a... Sold!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom)
Orville: (COUNTRY ACCENT) I caught my wife in bed with my best friend.
Hurley: (COUNTRY ACCENT) You bitter?
Orville: Yeah. Bit him too. (LAUGHS)
M.C.: (LAUGHS, THEN TURNS TO THE CAMERA) And now, once again, Lurleen.
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?
Marge Simpson: (WARMLY) Always has been.
Lurleen Lumpkin: (CHOKED UP) Now I'd like to play a song I wrote just this minute. It's called "Stand By Your Manager". (SINGS) HIS NAME IS HOMER/ HE'S QUITE A MAN/ I TRIED TO KISS HIM/ BUT HOMER RAN.

Dinosaur Dad: Would you turn off that rock 'n' rock music!
Dinosaur Son: Hey, don't have a Stegosaurus, man.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - night)
Lisa Simpson: (CHUCKLING) These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) Look Maggie, they have a baby, too.
Bart Simpson: It's like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen.
Marge Simpson: Now kids, I know you're all excited about meeting Aunt Selma's new boyfriend tonight.
Homer Simpson: Pfft.
Patty Bouvier: But I think that before he gets here, I should tell you something about him. (OMINOUS) Something... disturbing.
Lisa Simpson: Ewww.
Homer Simpson: Ooooh.
Bart Simpson: Bleuh.
Patty Bouvier: You see, Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession about not dying alone, so in desperation, she joined this prison pen-pal program. Her new sweetie's a jailbird.
Bart Simpson: Cool, he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunch tray.
Marge Simpson: Now, now, he's an ex-convict. He's paid his debt to society.
Patty Bouvier: Then how come you're not using the good silverware?
Marge Simpson: I'm just not.
Marge Simpson: That's them. Now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity.
Selma Bouvier: Everyone, I'd like you to meet --
Lisa Simpson: (SCREAM) Sideshow Bob!
Selma Bouvier: What the...?
Sideshow Bob: Selma dear, I'm afraid the children's reaction is quite understandable.
Sideshow Bob: You see, Bart here is the Shamus in short pants who sent me to prison.
Bart Simpson: That's right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery.
Homer Simpson: Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton.
Homer Simpson: Lousy snitch. (JABBING SOUND)
Bart Simpson: (WEAK LAUGH)
Sideshow Bob: (CHUCKLES) Ahh, Mr. Simpson, you're forgetting the first two noble truths of the Buddha.
Homer Simpson: I am not.
Sideshow Bob: Yes, you are. One: existence is suffering. Two: the cause of suffering is desire. In this case, my desire to do high-quality children's programming.
(Country Road: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY)
Sideshow Bob: When prison put an end to that dream, I became a seething cauldron of rage and recrimination...
(AWARDS SHOW SET: INT. AWARDS SHOW SET - EVENING)
Bart Simpson: Don't be a fool, Aunt Selma. That man is scum.
Selma Bouvier: Then call me Mrs. Scum!
Sideshow Bob: When I was nominated for best supporting performer in a children's program at the Daytime Emmy Awards, my bitterness ruined what should have been the greatest night of my life.
Krusty the Clown: And the nominees are: Droopy Drawers; Colonel Coward; Pepito the Biggest Cat in the Whole Wide World; Sideshow Bob; and Suck-up the Vacuum.
Krusty the Clown: And the Emmy goes to... (DISGRUNTLED) I don't believe this. Sideshow Bob.
(Springfield Prison: int. prison - bob's cell)
Sideshow Bob: This is one more Emmy than you'll ever win, you bantering jack-in-the-box!
Krusty the Clown: Just don't drop that thing in the shower, Bob.
Sideshow Bob: No-talent shill!
Krusty the Clown: Second banana!
Sideshow Bob: Panderer!
Krusty the Clown: Bore!
Sideshow Bob: Stop it, stop... release me... (STRUGGLING NOISES).
Krusty the Clown: (CLEARING THROAT) Now, for the highlight of the evening... Best film-to-video transfer...
Sideshow Bob: Do you know what prison is like for a life-long conservative Republican? In our over-crowded cell, we became little more than beasts.
Sideshow Bob: Who used my chapstick?
Cellmate #1: Oh, I did. Here you go.
Sideshow Bob: (TIGHTLY) I don't want it.
Sideshow Bob: My only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge against the boy who put me there...
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - dining room - present)
Bart Simpson: Aye-Carumba!
Sideshow Bob: (MENACING) Bart, if I wanted to kill you, I'd have choked you like a chicken as soon as I walked in that door.
FAMILY/EVERYONE: (GASPS)
Sideshow Bob: (CALM) But then what kind of a guest would I have been? (CHUCKLES)
Sideshow Bob: Now where was I... Ah yes, my lowest ebb.
(Springfield Prison: int. prison - sideshow bob's cell)
Sideshow Bob: (VERY UPSET) You can't take my Emmy!
Guard: Hey, you know the rules. Awards for excellence in entertainment are contraband. No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe.
Sideshow Bob: (MOANS) But kismet can be kind as well as cruel. I received an answer to my letter from the prison pen pal program.
Selma Bouvier: White.
Bart Simpson: Knock it off.
Selma Bouvier: Dear Number 24601, I need a man and I cannot find one among the law-abiding. I have a steady job, and a lucrative hobby filing nuisance law suits. I share an apartment with my twin sister. Enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike. I forget which one I am.
(Patty and Selma's Apartment: int. patty and selma's apartment - bathroom - a few days later)
Sideshow Bob: Dear Selma, your latest letter set off a riot in the maximum security wing of my heart.
Selma Bouvier: (HAPPY MOAN)
(Springfield Prison: int. prison - day)
Sideshow Bob: Like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard, our love bloomed despite all obstacles.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, may I?
Selma Bouvier: (SHAKES HEAD) Uh-uh-uh. On the cheek.
Sideshow Bob: Inspired by the love of a good woman, I resolved to be the best darned inmate Number 24601 I could be.
(Prison Gate: ext. prison gate - a few days later)
Sideshow Bob: I bade farewell to my cellmates and left with the woman I loved.
Sideshow Bob: Cutter... Ice pick... Snake, I'm going to miss you most of all.
(Simpson Home: int. SIMPSON house - DINING ROOM)
Lisa Simpson: What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob. You're living proof that our revolving door prison system works.
Marge Simpson: Selma, I've never seen you so happy. Giggling like a schoolgirl.
Selma Bouvier: (SPASMIC GUTTURAL NOISES)
Patty Bouvier: I've got to admit it, Selma. He's a once in a lifetime catch.
Sideshow Bob: Yes, I hope the police are saying that as well. (CHUCKLES)
Bart Simpson: I can't believe you guys. This man framed Krusty the Clown.
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Sideshow Bob: Indeed, I did. (EMOTIONAL) And I'd like to thank you for catching me, Bart. You seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell and pointed it straight towards the sunny shores of Selma.
Homer Simpson: Hear hear!.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, would you mind if I did something bold and shocking in front of your family?
Selma Bouvier: All right, but no tongues.
Sideshow Bob: Although kissing you would be like kissing some divine ashtray, that's not what I had in mind.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, will you marry me?
Selma Bouvier: (GASPS)
Sideshow Bob: (SIGHS) I suppose so.
Sideshow Bob: (SINGING) I KNOW I STAND IN LINE UNTIL I THINK YOU HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND AN EVENING WITH ME.
Selma Bouvier: (SINGING) AND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE TO DANCE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A CHANCE YOU WON'T BE LEAVIN' WITH ME.
Sideshow Bob: (SINGING) THEN AFTERWARDS WE DROP INTO A QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND HAVE A DRINK OR TWO.
Selma Bouvier: (SINGING) AND THEN I GO AND SPOIL IT ALL BY SAYIN' SOMETHIN' STUPID LIKE "I LOVE YOU".
Selma Bouvier: Ahhh... ahhh... Hmmmm... Could you pumice my corns for me?
Sideshow Bob: Avec plaisir.
Kindly Old Gent: A... G... Q... Seven...
Selma Bouvier: Close enough. May you drive safely and find true love.
Announcer: We now return to the Twenty-seventh Annual Krusty the Clown Telethon for Motion Sickness.
Krusty the Clown: Tiffany! (POINTING AT THE TOTE BOARD, BIG) Woo hoo! I love you people! I love my kids! (SAD) Poor little guys.
Krusty the Clown: So tragic. So nauseous. You should see the bus they came to the studio in (SOBS, THEN: CHEERFULLY) What's next? Oh yeah. And now, a man who needs no introduction -- the chairman of the company... you know who I'm talking about. Get out here, you goombah!
Crooner: Krusteleh, there's an old friend backstage who wants to say hello.
Krusty the Clown: Huh? Whuh?
Krusty the Clown: Come here you.
Sideshow Bob: Oh... oh... oh, you old clown you. (CHUCKLES)
Krusty the Clown: Oh, I missed ya.

Sideshow Bob: Krusty, can you ever forgive me for framing you and putting you in jail?
Krusty the Clown: Hey, if they ever open the books on this telethon, I'm right back in there.
Bart Simpson: That Sideshow Bob is a no-good showbiz phony.
Lisa Simpson: Come on, Bart. If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too.
Sideshow Bob: Oh Krusty, I can't tell you how much I missed this.
Marge Simpson: Now, about your wedding dress. I'm not sure how to put this...
Marge Simpson: (WRITING) White. And what would you like for appetizers?
Homer Simpson: Oooh, appetizers.
Sideshow Bob: Well Homer, you seem to be a trencherman. What should we serve?
Homer Simpson: Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!
Sideshow Bob: Well, Selma, he makes a good case.
Selma Bouvier: Get whatever you want. It all tastes like styrofoam to me.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, dear -- I'm confused.
Selma Bouvier: Well, when I was a kid we were playing with bottle rockets, and one shot straight up my nose. I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell.
Marge Simpson: Okay, we've got cocktail wienies and Swedish meatballs.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, this wedding is spinning out of control. Can we really afford it? I've already run through eight of the ten dollars they gave me when I left prison.
Selma Bouvier: Hey relax, I told ya I got money. I bought stock in a mace company just before society crumbled.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, that's wonderful. I just hope people don't think I'm marrying you for your money, instead of your... (SEARCHING) less tangible qualities.
(Park: ext. park)
Sideshow Bob: Tomorrow we'll be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Terwilliger. Isn't it grand?
Selma Bouvier: Hey, Bob. Give some of that honey this way.

Selma Bouvier: What did I miss?
Patty Bouvier: MacGyver was wearing a tank top.
Selma Bouvier: Dang.
Sideshow Bob: Why Selma, I thought I was the only man in your life.
Selma Bouvier: Sit down and shut up.
Man: Thank you, Señor MacGyver. You saved our village.
MacGyver: Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull.
Selma Bouvier: That MacGyver's a genius.
Marge Simpson: Ah, that's sweet.
Sideshow Bob: First of all he's not a genius, he's an actor. And second, he's not much of an actor.
Selma Bouvier: You're lying! You're lying!
Sideshow Bob: No Selma, this is lying: that was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to retch.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - a little later)
Selma Bouvier: He was so cruel... The things he said, they're just not true.
Marge Simpson: There, there...
Bart Simpson: Oh well, I guess the wedding's off. Fiddle dee dee, tomorrow's another day.
Marge Simpson: Bart! Stop that.
Selma Bouvier: No, he's right. We're a package. Love me, love MacGyver. (SADLY) I guess the wedding's off.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, I don't know what to say.
Selma Bouvier: Just tell me you like MacGyver.
Sideshow Bob: Very well. I... I... I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on.
Homer Simpson: Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?
Homer Simpson: Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love.
Sideshow Bob: Very well, Selma, whenever you watch MacGyver, I'll take a vigorous constitutional and return more in love with you than ever.
Selma Bouvier: Oh Bob.
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Bart no like. Bad medicine.

Selma Bouvier: ... Except for after meals and after MacGyver.
Sideshow Bob: Why Selma dear, you'll bury us all. (LITTLE CHUCKLE)
Bart Simpson: Chief Wiggum, you've been around. You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you?
Chief Wiggum: Ahh, lighten up, son. If he was going to commit a crime, would he have invited the No. 1 cop in town? (BEAT) Now, where did I put my gun? (THINKS) Oh, yeah. I set it down when I got a piece of cake...
Patty Bouvier: I don't know what to say.

Sideshow Bob: I wanted a room with a fireplace you brainless luggage monkey! Like the one in your brochure!
Sideshow Bob: Oh, Selma dear, I was just chatting with my good friend, (READS NAMETAG) Dennis. Now, smile for the camera. That's a good lad.
Sideshow Bob: (TO HIMSELF) Ah, fire: scourge of Prometheus, toaster of marshmallows, (SINISTER) eradicator of deadwood... (SEEING CAMERA) Oh Selma dear, you and your little camera. What do you say we shut it off for a while?
Selma Bouvier: And make love?
Bart Simpson: Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace?
Marge Simpson: Because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.
Bart Simpson: Romantic? With Aunt Selma?
Marge Simpson: I guess you're just too young to understand.
(Shelbyville Hotel Suite: INT. SHELBYVILLE HOTEL ROOM - DAY)

Sideshow Bob: Darling, you make it sound like a chore.
Selma Bouvier: Hmm, uh, good...
Sideshow Bob: (LOW) Soon I will kill you.
Selma Bouvier: Huh?

Sideshow Bob: My best laid plans have gang aglay!

Chief Wiggum: Well no, frankly, but that never stopped us before.
Sideshow Bob: Bart, I must know. How did you untangle my web?
Chief Wiggum: Yeah, Bart. Fill us in.
Bart Simpson: Well, I'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do his job.
Chief Wiggum: No, no, please. It's the only way I'll learn.
Bart Simpson: All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas.
Bart Simpson: Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except Aunt Selma.
Selma Bouvier: I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell.
Bart Simpson: She happily watched her MacGyver, unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas. All it needed to explode was a single spark... say, from a cigarette...
Selma Bouvier: I decided to give up smoking... except for after meals, and after MacGyver.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - an hour earlier)
Bart Simpson: Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.
Bart Simpson: Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come!
Homer Simpson: Come again?
Bart Simpson: After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way.
Homer Simpson: To the Simpson mobile!
(Hotel Room: int. hotel room - after macgyver)
Bart Simpson: Noooo!

Bart Simpson: Thanks, Mom. Now. Let's get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)

Marge Simpson: My little guy's first rock concert. I hope the Spinal Taps don't play too loud.
Homer Simpson: Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything.

Marty: Fellows, I'm gonna hit you with a phrase that has dogged you throughout your career: washed-up.
Bill: Yet here you are among the top one hundred and five concert acts today. What's your secret guys?
David: Well, after the Berlin Wall fell, our records started selling on the dismal side of the Iron Curtain, and naturally that gave us a boost.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: We're very big in Bulgaria, and wassisname, the other garia.
David: Hungaria.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Yeah, whoever.
DEREK: I can't think of anyone who's benefited more from the death of Communism than us.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Oh, maybe the people who actually live in the Communist countries.
DEREK: Oh yeah, hadn't thought of that. I bet you're right.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Yeah, on the other hand, each of us just bought out own soccer team. How many Hungarias can say that, eh?
Roadie: Test... test...
Bart Simpson: Gee, I'm sorry, man.
Stoned Guy: Huh?
Bart Simpson: About the frisbee.
Stoned Guy: Frisbee?
Bill: Say guys, I wonder if you'd mind recording a couple of promos for us.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Well, like what?
Marty: Maybe you could say, "Nobody rocks like Bill and Marty on KBBL."
David: Well, we don't know that, do we?
Nigel Bakerbutcher: What if somebody rocks as good as you?
DEREK: Or better. I mean, we don't want to look stupid.
Bill: Okay, we can respect that.
Marty: How about "Rock-a-doodle-do, you're listening to Bill and Marty."
David: Yeah, sure.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: That's good... yeah.
(CONCERT ARENA: int. conCert arena - a little later)
Crowd: Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap!
David: I just looked out, and there's puddles of water all over the freakin' stage!
Bart Simpson: I said slag off!
David: Yeah, well this is a rock concert, not the bleedin' (THINKING)...Splish Splash show!
(Arena: int. arena - a little later)
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Duff Beer, in association with Laramie Cigarettes, is proud to welcome... SPINAL TAP!
David: WE ARE THE CHILDREN WHO GREW TOO FAST...
DAVID/NIGEL: WE ARE THE DUST OF THE FUTURE PAST...
DAVID/NIGEL/DEREK: WE RAISE OUR VOICES IN THE NIGHT/ CRYING TO HEAVEN...
David: AND WILL OUR VOICES BE HEARD/ OR WILL THEY BREAK LIKE THE WIND!
David: (YELLING AT ROADIE) Medium setting!
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - continuous)
(COLISEUM: int. coliseum - later)
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Thank you!
David: All riiiight! This morning we were driving down...(DRAMATICALLY) Route 401...
Bart Simpson: That's only four miles from my house!
Nigel Bakerbutcher: And we thought they knew how to rock in Shelbyville...
DEREK: But nobody rocks like...Springfield!
Nigel Bakerbutcher: (ON MIKE, PISSED) Well, it seems some silly twit did not get a big enough oxygen pump, but that's supposed to be a devil.
David: Filled up with air, it's very evil and impressive.
DEREK: (MAKING DEVIL SALUTE) We salute you, our half-inflated Dark Lord.
DEREK: Y'know, people think there are only five members of Spinal Tap, but they're wrong.
David: (ANNOYED) Could we turn up the house lights please? That was the cue to turn up the house lights, so we can tell the audience they're the sixth member of the freakin' group.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: We are trying to put a tiny thrill into their gray little lives. Oh, forget it, turn on the lasers.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Aagh! My vision!
Nigel Bakerbutcher: That's it. Show's over.
David: Goodnight, Springton. There will be no encores.
Milhouse Van Houten: (CHECKS WATCH) They were only on for twenty minutes!
Bart Simpson: What a gyp!
Otto Mann: Gnarly show, man.
Snake Jailbird: Wanna trash the stage?
Otto Mann: Okay.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - continuous)
Bart Simpson: Cool.

(CONCERT ARENA: int. concert arena)
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - night)
Kent Brockman: Tonight a city weeps as, for the first time ever, a hockey arena becomes a scene of violence --following a concert by Spinal Tap.
Marge Simpson: (VERY WORRIED) Hmmm, I hope my poor little baby's okay.
Lisa Simpson: (POINTING AT TV) See for yourself.
Marge Simpson: (GASPS)
Kent Brockman: Of course, it would be wrong to suggest that this sort of mayhem began with rock and roll. After all, there were riots at the premiere of Mozart's "The Magic Flute". So what's the answer? Ban all music? In this reporter's opinion the answer, sadly, is yes.
Bart Simpson: (CHEERFULLY) Hi, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Oh, oh... thank God!
Bart Simpson: Mom, I want to be a rock star.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) We'll discuss it later. Is Milhouse okay?
Homer Simpson: I'll be right back.
(CONCERT ARENA: INT. CONCERT ARENA - NIGHT)
Milhouse Van Houten: (WEAKLY) Help! Help!
(Simpson Home: INT. simpson house - MAGGIE'S ROOM - NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I've been thinking about what Bart said. If he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should BUY him A GUITAR.
Homer Simpson: Well, that's a waste of money. We already have a guitar.
Marge Simpson: I meant a real guitar.
Homer Simpson: This is real.
Bart Simpson: Wow!
Marge Simpson: And it came with a free instruction book.
Homer Simpson: Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow!
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him.
Bart Simpson: (SULLEN BRITISH ACCENT) I'd like to play me latest chart-topper. It's called "Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs."
(Hotel: int. hotel - day)
Bart Simpson: (MOANS)
Manager: Bart, you've got to go on.
Bart Simpson: Slag off!
Milhouse Van Houten: (SHAKING HEAD) You've changed, man. You used to be about the music.
Lisa Simpson: (SMUG) I'se just jammin' with you.
(EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP: int. ext. school bus stop - morning)
Nelson Muntz: Hey, Simpson, what are you trying to play?
Bart Simpson: (SMALL VOICE) Polly Wolly Doodle.
Nelson Muntz: Oh yeah, well it sounds Polly Wolly Crappy. Haw haw! Burn.
Otto Mann: Hey, cherry axe, Bart-dude.
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) I think it's broken.
Otto Mann: Oh, really? Give it here.
Bart Simpson: I didn't know you played the guitar, Otto-man!
Otto Mann: Hey, that's all I did in high school. My old man said I was wasting my time and I'd never amount to anything. (LAUGHS)
Otto Mann: (STRUMS GUITAR) Now I'd like to slow things down a little bit...
Otto Mann: (SINGING) IF I LEAVE HERE TOMORROW... WOULD YOU STILL REMEMBER ME?
(Bus: int. bus - later)
Otto Mann: (SINGING) ...CANNOT CHAEAEAEANGE... WAOWAOWAOWAOW...
Martin Prince: Although I'm sure I will receive a severe wedgie from my bus mates, I must remind you we should have been at school ten minutes ago.
Martin Prince: (LOSING HIS BALANCE) Whoooa!
Otto Mann: Uh oh. Better fasten your seatbelts, little dudes.
Lisa Simpson: We don't have seatbelts.
Otto Mann: Huh... well then, just try to go limp.
Otto Mann: (CHECKS WATCH) Better take a shortcut.

(Springfield Town Square: ext. town square - continuous)
(Skinner's Office: int. principal skinner's office - a little later)
Seymour Skinner: Oh, it's a miracle no one was hurt.
Otto Mann: I stand on my record. Fifteen crashes and not a single fatality.
Lou: Let's see your license, pal.
Otto Mann: No can do. Never got one. But if you need proof of my identity, I wrote my name on my underwear.
Otto Mann: Oh, wait, these aren't mine.
(Apartment Building: int. apartment building - hallway - nightANGLE - SKINNER)
Seymour Skinner: Well, that tears it. Until you get a license and wear your own underwear, mister, you are suspended without pay.
Otto Mann: Who's gonna drive the bus?
Seymour Skinner: I drove an all-terrain vehicle in Da Nang. I think I can handle it.
(School Bus: ext. school bus - day)
Bart Simpson: Where's Otto?
Seymour Skinner: (BITTERLY) Otto. That's one palindrome you won't be hearing for awhile.
Bart Simpson: (GASPS)
Seymour Skinner: Off we go!
Kids: HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER / HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN.
Seymour Skinner: HE DRINKS AND HE CUSSES / HE STINKS UP THE BUSSES/HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN! (SKINNER:) HA HA!
Seymour Skinner: Dum de dum... There's an opening. Too late!... Nope... Nope... That'd be cutting it a little close.
Lisa Simpson: I think you have to be more aggressive, sir.
Seymour Skinner: Nonsense. One of our good citizens will slow down and wave me in.
(Department of Motor Vehicles: ext. department of motor vehicles - establishing)
Patty Bouvier: (LAUGHS)
Selma Bouvier: What's so funny?
Patty Bouvier: I was just thinking about the time Homer got his nose caught in the toaster.
Selma Bouvier: We'll watch the tape tonight. Oh look, you've got someone at your window.
Otto Mann: (SINGING) Dododo do do do.
Patty Bouvier: My name's Patty. I'll be testing you. (POINTS TO SHIRT POCKET) When you do good, I use the green pen. When you do bad, I use the red pen. Any questions?
Otto Mann: Yeah, one. Have you always been a chick? I mean, I don't want to offend you but you were born a man, weren't you? You can tell me, I'm open-minded.
Patty Bouvier: I won't be needing this.
(SERPENTINE COURSE: ext. serpentine course - day)
Otto Mann: All right! Yeah!... So, how'd I do?
Patty Bouvier: Well, you failed every segment and misspelled "bus" on your application.
Otto Mann: Drag.

Ralph Wiggum: (SINGS) HE STEPS ON THE CLUTCH, AND THE TOILET GOES FLUSH / HAIL TO THE--
Otto Mann: Hey Landlord, some clown changed my locks, padlocked the door and put up an eviction notice.
Landlord: Yeah, that was me.
Otto Mann: You! But... but why?
Landlord: Because you haven't paid your rent.
Otto Mann: Well, can I at least get my stuff?
Landlord: All I found in there was a jar of mustard and a couple of old cycle magazines.
Otto Mann: Wow, I had mustard?
(Kwik-E-Mart: int. kwik-E-mart - DAY)
Bart Simpson: Rough day, Apu. Pump me a Squishee and don't spare the syrup.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Perhaps you'd like to try an experimental flavor of my own concoction. A delicious Chutney-Squishee.
Bart Simpson: Uh... okay.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: You can really taste the chutney.
Bart Simpson: (SOURLY) Uggh...
Otto Mann: Ow!
Bart Simpson: Otto-man?
Bart Simpson: You're living in a dumpster?
Otto Mann: Oh, man, I wish. "Dumpster" brand trash bins are top of the line. This is just a "Trash-Co" waste disposal unit.
Bart Simpson: (UPSET) Otto, why don't you come home with me? You can stay in our garage.
Otto Mann: (HAPPY) A garage?! Oh, somebody up there likes me.
Otto Mann: (MOANS)
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - night - establishing)

Otto Mann: (SINGING) I FEEL LIKE ROCKIN' SO I THINK I WILL / I'LL ROCK IT, ROCK IT, ROCK IT 'TIL I GET MY FILL... YEAH!
Otto Mann: Ooh! Hey.
Marge Simpson: Bart, what's going on?
Bart Simpson: Mom, I thought you might forget our little conversation this afternoon, so I took the precaution of recording it.
Marge Simpson: (PUZZLED) What conversation?
Bart Simpson: (ON TAPE) Mom, can Otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? (IMITATING MARGE) He sure can!
Homer Simpson: Marge, what were you thinking?
Marge Simpson: That's not my voice!
Homer Simpson: Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - 3:30 a.m.)
Marge Simpson: I don't understand this. Why can't you stay with your parents?
Otto Mann: (CHUCKLES) The admiral and I don't get along. (TO HOMER) Please let me stay here. I've got nowhere else to go.
Homer Simpson: Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.
Bart Simpson: Dad, Otto's going through a real tough time. Can't he stay with us for awhile?
Marge Simpson: I know we didn't ask for this, Homer, but doesn't the Bible say, "Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"
Homer Simpson: Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, "Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut"?
Bart Simpson: Please, Dad. If you let Otto stay, he'll help around the house, and chip in a few bucks whenever he can.
Homer Simpson: (GRUDGINGLY) All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage.
Otto Mann: (TAKEN ABACK) Wow, what's the catch?
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - day)
Tv Host: A can of corn costs... fifty-seven cents!
Otto Mann: I could sure go for a can of corn.
Marge Simpson: Otto, you can't just sit there watching TV all day.
Otto Mann: You know, you're right. I should do a little reading. (CHECKS BOOKSHELF) You got any of those "Where's Waldo" books?
Marge Simpson: No.
Otto Mann: How about anything written from the Vampire's point of view?
Marge Simpson: No.
Otto Mann: Well, how 'bout anything where guys send in naked pictures of their chicks?
Marge Simpson: Otto, I think you should get a job.
Otto Mann: Look, the only thing I was ever good at was driving a bus and now "the man" says I need a piece of paper to do that.
Marge Simpson: So get that piece of paper!
Otto Mann: I tried -- Oh, Lord, how I did try.
(GARAGE: INT. GARAGE - evening)
Homer Simpson: Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think.
Homer Simpson: That's better. (TO BART) Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?
Bart Simpson: I'll tell you the truth, Dad. I wasn't good at it right away, so I quit. I hope you're not mad.
Bart Simpson: You can do it, Otto. You're the coolest adult I ever met.
Milhouse Van Houten: Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson: (KINDLY) Son, come here. (BART GETS ON HOMER'S KNEE) Heh, heh, heh. Of course I'm not mad. If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch TV.
Bart Simpson: (SMILES) What's on?
Homer Simpson: (WARMLY) It doesn't matter.
(Simpson Bathroom: ext. simpson bathroom - morning)
Homer Simpson: Open up! Open up! I gotta go and no fooling.
Otto Mann: Hey, Pop 'N'Fresh. (BEAT) You're supposed to giggle.
Homer Simpson: (GROWLS)
Homer Simpson: (GROSSED-OUT NOISE)
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - night)
Homer Simpson: That guy has gotta go.
Marge Simpson: I know how you feel, but he is good with the kids.
Otto Mann: (DRAMATICALLY) ... So the lady drove faster, but the strange car kept banging into her from behind.
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS)
Otto Mann: So finally she swerves off the road into the woods and lost the other car. (QUIETLY) And that's when she realized the man in the other car wasn't trying to hurt her. No, he was trying to warn her... about the ax-wielding maniac hiding in her back seat!
Lisa Simpson: (PETRIFIED, TINY VOICE) Did the maniac kill her?
Otto Mann: Natch! And you know how I know?
Lisa Simpson: How?
Otto Mann: Because... (LEANS IN) I was that maniac!
Otto Mann: (ALARMED) Hey, hey, I was just kidding.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR) That's it. He's outta here.
Marge Simpson: But Homer, we're the only family he's got...
Homer Simpson: I don't care. This is not "Happy Days" and he is not the Fonz.
Otto Mann: (ENTERING) Heyyy, Mr. S...
Homer Simpson: Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house!
Otto Mann: (CRESTFALLEN) Heavy.
Bart Simpson: What are you going to do, Otto?
Otto Mann: Oh, don't worry. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who knows how to fake his own death.
Marge Simpson: Well, before you do that, maybe you should take the driving test again.
Otto Mann: (SIGHS) Oh, I can't pass that thing. I got a zero last time; this time I'm hung over.
Otto Mann: Wow! I've never been called an adult before. I've been tried as one but... (THINKS) I'll do it!
(Simpson Garage: Int. Simpson garage)
Otto Mann: (READING) "Alcohol increases your ability to drive." (READS AHEAD, THEN, SURPRISED) False? Oh, man.
(Department of Motor Vehicles: ext. DMV - day)
Otto Mann: I don't know about this Bart dude. Your dad is right, I am a bum.
Bart Simpson: He didn't call you a bum, he called you a sponge.
Otto Mann: Sponge?!
Otto Mann: Does this look like something a sponge would do (MUTTERING) I'll show him who's a sponge.
Patty Bouvier: Well, if it isn't Wee Willy Washout.
Otto Mann: I want to take the test again.
Patty Bouvier: Why?
Otto Mann: So I can staple my license to Homer Simpson's big bald head.
Patty Bouvier: (PLEASED) Really? Well, here's your written test.
Patty Bouvier: (CONSPIRATORIALLY) I'll get you started. (QUICKLY) B, C, D, A, B.
(TESTING COURSE: ext. testing course - later)
Otto Mann: Homer had a piece of food on his face for three days.
Patty Bouvier: (LAUGHS HEARTILY)
Otto Mann: It wasn't little either. It was a chicken wing.
Patty Bouvier: (LAUGHS) Wing. (LAUGHS MORE)
Otto Mann: What was that?
Patty Bouvier: It doesn't matter. Let's get some Margaritas. I'm buyin'!
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. springfield elementary - end of the day)

Milhouse Van Houten: Hey, Bart, look at this. My dad took me to Circus of Values last night and said I could get anything I wanted.
Bart Simpson: Cool! An oversized novelty billiard ball.
Milhouse Van Houten: (HOLDING UP OVERSIZED PLASTIC 8-BALL) Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the future.
Bart Simpson: (GRABBING BALL) Will I pass my English test?
Bart Simpson: (READING) "Outlook not so good." Wow! It does work!
Milhouse Van Houten: Let me try. (SHAKING 8-BALL) Will I get beat up today? (READS 8-BALL) "All signs point to yes."
Nelson Muntz: That ball knows everything. (UGH)
Bart Simpson: Hey, I got a good one. (TALKS TO 8-BALL) Will Milhouse and I be friends till we're toothless old men with hair coming out of our ears? READING BALL, SURPRISED) "Don't count on it." Will Milhouse and I be friends when we're high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? (SHAKES, READS 8-BALL) "It looks doubtful." (WORRIED) Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day?
Bart Simpson: What could come between two bestest buddies like us?
(Springfield Elementary School: int. Springfield elementary - skinner's office - continuous)
Seymour Skinner: Samantha I've always been suspicious of transfer students... Other principals try to unload problem cases that way... Lord knows I do.
Samantha Stanky: I'm a good student, Principal Skinner.
Seymour Skinner: (SKEPTICAL) Yeah sure, and they told me I'd get a big parade when I got back from 'Nam. Instead they spat on me. I can still feel it searing. (UPBEAT) So, now let's just see what the permanent record has to say, shall we?
Seymour Skinner: Hmm... no detention... fairly good attendance record... Oh, I see you beat that bed wetting problem in the second grade.
Samantha Stanky: That's in there?
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLES) Don't worry. They'll forget. (SEETHING) Just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for eighteen agonizing months. Every night I'd wake up screaming. (THEN, UPBEAT) Well, let's meet your classmates.
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey Bart, was this thing right about your test?
Bart Simpson: To those who doubt the power of the Magic 8-Ball, I say "Behold my "F!"
Seymour Skinner: (CLEARS THROAT) Attention class, I have a new student for you.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Great, another student. Just keep packing 'em in, Seymour.
Seymour Skinner: I think we should discuss this later, Edna. (TO CLASS) Now, it's never easy to come to a new school, so let's make her feel right at home. Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky.
Samantha Stanky: Stanky.
Seymour Skinner: Oh, right. How embarrassing for you. Well, goodbye.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I'm sure this is a little scary for you, dear.
Samantha Stanky: (SMALL VOICE) Uh-huh.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: So why don't you stand up in front of the class and tell us about yourself? I'll be grading you on grammar and poise.
Samantha Stanky: We just moved here from Phoenix. My Dad owns a home security company. He came to Springfield because of its high crime rate and lackluster police force. All my friends are back in Phoenix, and this town has a weird smell that you're all probably used to -- but I'm not.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: It'll take you about six weeks, dear.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet willie?
Milhouse Van Houten: Sure.
Milhouse Van Houten: Eew!
Bart Simpson: (CHUCKLING) Victim number four. (CALLING OFF) Hey, Lewis, can I interest you in a wet willie?
Lewis Clark: Sure!
Milhouse Van Houten: (MOANS)
Milhouse Van Houten: When I find out who hit me with that ball... I'm gonna tear 'em a new...
Milhouse Van Houten: (STUNNED) Wuh.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Class, in order to explain why your hormones will soon make you an easy target for every smooth talking Lothario with his own car and tight jeans, I will now show a short sex education film.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Ezekiel and Ismail, in accordance with your parents' wishes, you may step out into the hall and pray for our souls.
(CLASSROOM: int. classroom - continuous)
Bart Simpson: Bo-ring!
Kids: Eew!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: She's faking it.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (BORED) Any questions?
Nelson Muntz: Mrs. Krabappel, how come you don't live with Mr. Krabappel?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Because Mr. Krabappel chased something small and fluffy down a rabbit hole.
Samantha Stanky: How do we know when we fall in love?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Oh, don't you worry. Most of you will never fall in love and marry out of fear of dying alone. (CHUCKLES)
Bart Simpson: How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I'm sorry, that would be playing God.
Bart Simpson: God shmod, I want my monkey-man.
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. school - afternoon)
Milhouse Van Houten: Ah, that's a nice dress.
Samantha Stanky: My dad makes me wear it. I hate it.

Samantha Stanky: Okay.
(Bus: INT. BUS - THAT MOMENT)
Otto Mann: Everybody on, but no shoving. (BEAT) Just kiddin', you can shove all you want.

(Bart's Treehouse: int. treehouse - day)
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, what a pleasant surprise.
Samantha Stanky: Hi.
Bart Simpson: (ANGRY) Hey, what's with the skirt?
Milhouse Van Houten: I've brought friends to this treehouse before.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, but never a girl. What if I want to strut around nude?
Samantha Stanky: Maybe I should go.
Homer Simpson: So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories.
(POOL: ext. pool - day)
Bart Simpson: No, that's okay. You can stay. You can read comics with us. (DIGGING THROUGH PILE) Let's see, something for the lady...ah, "Radioactive Man Vs. the Swamp Hag.
Samantha Stanky: Got any girl comics? Like "Bonnie Craine, Girl Attorney," "Punkin & Duncan, the Twinkle Twins," or "L'il Kneesocks?"
Bart Simpson: No, but my sister's got a wide selection of crappy comics.
Bart Simpson: (GROSSED OUT NOISE) you guys wanna see something gross?
Bart Simpson: (GASPS)
Announcer: Tonight on Smartline -- "I'm Okay, You're Too Fat". Here's your host, Kent Brockman.
Kent Brockman: Good evening. Did you know that thirty-four million American adults are obese? Taken together, that excess blubber could fill the Grand Canyon two-fifths of the way up. That may not sound impressive, but keep in mind it is a very big canyon.
(Simpson Home: int. SIMPSON HOUSE - living room - night)
Homer Simpson: This sucks. Where is that channel changer?
Homer Simpson: (SEVERAL FEEBLE GRUNTS) Oh, eh, I'll give it a chance.
Kent Brockman: Americans have grown up with the image of the jolly fat man. Dom DeLuise, Alfred Hitchcock, and of course, Santa Claus. But in real life, Santa would be suffering from gallstones, hypertension, impotence, and diabetes.
Marge Simpson: (SOBBING) I wish they had never invented fried cheese!
Grave Digger: We've got to widen the hole.
Crane Operator: (WISE GUY VOICE) Well, make it snappy. The chain's startin' to give!
Female Announcer: (SEDUCTIVELY) We take eighteen ounces of sizzling ground beef and soak it in rich creamery butter. Then we top it off with bacon, ham and a fried egg. We call it the "Good Morning Burger!"
Homer Simpson: (SHUDDERS IN AWE)
Lisa Simpson: I gotta help him.
(Bart's Treehouse: int. tree house - day)
Samantha Stanky: (LOUD KISSING NOISES)
Bart Simpson: Okay, Milhouse... I'll trade your Carl Yastrzemski baseball card for my Omar Vizquel.
Bart Simpson: Deal! Next on the trading block, your Mickey Mantle -- 1958, mint condition -- for my picture of Homer on the couch.
Samantha Stanky: Milhouse, I gotta go.
Samantha Stanky: My dad thinks I'm having my braces examined.
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, you kinda-sorta are. (CHUCKLES)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, we're living in the age of cooties. I can't believe the risk you're running. Besides, what's so great about kissing?
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, it's not just the kissing. A lot of it is waitin' to kiss. You know like when you open an Eskimo Pie and you wait just a little bit for it to melt?
Bart Simpson: But she doesn't melt.
Milhouse Van Houten: (SMOOTHLY) Oh yes she does!
Female Announcer: (SEDUCTIVELY) We start with pure milk chocolate...
Homer Simpson: Chocolate...
Female Announcer: Add a layer of farm-fresh honey...
Homer Simpson: Ooh, sweet.
Female Announcer: Then we sprinkle on four kinds of sugar...
Female Announcer: And dip it in rich creamery butter.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, what if I told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?
Homer Simpson: I'd say "You're a lying scumbag." Why sweetie?
Lisa Simpson: According to Eternity Magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. That's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
Homer Simpson: Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter.
Lisa Simpson: They'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. As you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less.
Homer Simpson: Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge?

Bart Simpson: (GLUM) He has a girlfriend.
Marge Simpson: Milhouse? (GIGGLES)

Bart Simpson: Listen Martin, right now I'm looking for a friend who won't leave me for a girl.
Martin Prince: That's me. I'm just as unpopular with the ladies as I am with the chaps.
Bart Simpson: (QUICKLY) Yeah, right. Anyway... do you want to do something after school?

Marge Simpson: I don't know if that tape is working. You ate three desserts tonight.
Homer Simpson: Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
Marge Simpson: (PUZZLED) There's another thing I've been wanting to talk to you about...
Homer Simpson: Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!

Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Bart Simpson: Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't the three of us go spit on the Principal's car?
Milhouse Van Houten: Listen, Bart... there's such a thing as spendin' too much time together.
Bart Simpson: (BEAT) Oh. Fine. I'm tired of watching you two lip wrestle. There's plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town.
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, wait!
Bart Simpson: (HOPEFUL) Yeah?
Milhouse Van Houten: Uh... can we still use your tree house?
Bart Simpson: What? Get bent.
Milhouse Van Houten: If her father catches us -- he'll kill her.
Bart Simpson: All right, Milhouse. You can use my tree house. (SLY)

Mr. Stanky: Samantha, you're my little girl and sometimes my imagination runs away with me. Just, just tell me what happened.
Samantha Stanky: Well, Milhouse and I --
Mr. Stanky: That's enough! I'm putting you in an all girls school. You're never going to see that boy again.
Samantha Stanky: Milhouse!
Milhouse Van Houten: Samantha!
Bart Simpson: Well Milhouse, "'Tis better to have loved and lost"... yada yada yada... let's go to the arcade.

Bart Simpson: Five fingers? Ew, freak show. (BEAT) Listen, Lis. I need some advice and mom's not here.
Lisa Simpson: Why didn't you go to dad?
Bart Simpson: I did, but I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying. Lisa, I feel terrible. I ratted on my best friend and he doesn't even know I did it.
Lisa Simpson: (FLIPPING PAGES) Well, according to "Eternity" magazine, the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine. Dow chemical is developing a minty gel, which will eliminate excess guilt, but unfortunately it won't be on the market for another six months. So I guess you're gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to Milhouse.

Milhouse Van Houten: Well, I didn't want you to see me cry this time.
(MEDICAL TESTING AREA: int. medical testing area)

Samantha Stanky: Milhouse!
Milhouse Van Houten: Samantha, I went to Circus of Values to buy you a ten gallon tub of Gummy Bears.
Bart Simpson: Hey Samantha, I'm sorry about gettin' you thrown in the penguin house.
Samantha Stanky: (SOUNDING BORN AGAIN) That's all right, Bart. I love Saint Sebastian's. It's run by a group of French Canadian nuns. They're very nice, except they never let me out.

Waylon Smithers: Sir, I'm afraid Homer Simpson is sterile.
C. Montgomery Burns: Who?
Waylon Smithers: One of your cabbage heads from Sector 7-G. Take a look at this sperm sample from his recent physical.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ewww.
Waylon Smithers: Now, compare this with a normal sperm sample.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hm. Oh yes.
Waylon Smithers: I'm afraid radiation from the plant is the reason he's shooting blanks. He could sue us for millions.

Lawyer: I'll have some coffee.
C. Montgomery Burns: Want it black, don't you? Black like your heart! It's so hard for me to listen to you, I hate you all so much... I'm sorry. It's my problem. I'll deal with it. Please continue.
Lawyer: If you offer Mr. Simpson a token sum -- say, a couple thou -- he'll be so dazzled, he'll sign anything you shove under his nose.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SNEERING) Oh, brilliant. A cash settlement. I could have figured that out, you button-down maggot.

HERB: Forbes Magazine called it the "Blunder of the Century." A little overblown, don't you think? What about new Coke?
WILLIAM POWEL LOOKALIKE: Hey, I invented that.
HERB: Yeah, but all that's in the past. Because this is America and in America you're never finished as long as you've got a brain in your head. Because all a man really needs is an idea.

Bart Simpson: (INNOCENT) We were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise.
Lisa Simpson: (DRAMATIC) We leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
Bart Simpson: There, there. You're safe now, little sister.

Homer Simpson: (SUSPICIOUS) Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it.
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISGUSTED NOISE) All right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence!

Homer Simpson: (SADLY) I miss my couch.
Smokin' Joe Frazier: I know how you feel. You lost a couch. I lost a heavyweight championship.
Homer Simpson: Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind.
Smokin' Joe Frazier: Homer, I know things are tough now. But one day you'll be walking along and you'll see a piece of furniture that you can love just as much.
Barney Gumble: Hey, Frazier, shut up!
Smokin' Joe Frazier: Barney, you've been riding my back all night.

Lisa Simpson: Dad? Dad?
Homer Simpson: (BEING VIBRATED) I'll take it.
Marge Simpson: This chair is $2,000. We could buy a whole living room set for that.
Homer Simpson: Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer.
Marge Simpson: This money was a blessing. We can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
Homer Simpson: All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky.

Lisa Simpson: (JOYOUSLY) Unky Herb!
HERB: Bart... Lisa. I'm so glad to see you.
Homer Simpson: (RUBBING JAW) You weren't so glad to see me.
HERB: I'm sorry, Homer. But I'm still mad at you. Every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face.
Homer Simpson: Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?
HERB: I'll try, but I'm not making any promises.
Marge Simpson: (GASPS) Herb! How have you been?
HERB: I've been living in a cardboard box, sleeping on grates, eatin' out of dumpsters. You?
Marge Simpson: Can't complain.
Homer Simpson: Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode.

Marge Simpson: I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel.
Homer Simpson: They do good work.
Bart Simpson: Unky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?
HERB: Discarded pizza boxes are an inexpensive source of cheese.
HERB: Lisa, aren't you happy to see me?
Lisa Simpson: Why didn't you write, Unky Herb?
HERB: Hey if I wrote to you what was I supposed to say? "Dear Lisa, last night I used a rat for a pillow thanks to your pop.
Lisa Simpson: I see your point.
HERB: (SINGS SOFTLY) "WHETHER YOU'RE DRIVING NEAR OR FAR / POWELL MAKES A POW-POW-POWERFUL CAR!" (CHUCKLES)
HERB: Maggie, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. You're gonna make me rich again. (BABY TALK) Yes-oo are! Yes-oo are!
HERB: One, two, three... Ventnor Avenue.
Lisa Simpson: And while on Ventnor Avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. Of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill.
HERB: Get to the point.
Lisa Simpson: (MERCILESS) Eleven hundred and fifty bones.
HERB: That's all I got.
Homer Simpson: (AMUSED) Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. (CHUCKLES) I guess you're just not much of a businessman.
Homer Simpson: (MOAN)
Marge Simpson: Maybe we should play another game.
Bart Simpson: Why are we playin' games when we got two grand in the bank!? Remember when Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence?
Lisa Simpson: Well, I think we should invest in a set of the great books of Western Civilization. Look at this ad from "New Republic for Kids." Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: "Paradise Regained," "Martin Chuzzlewit," or Herman Melville's twin classics "Omoo" and "Typee".
Homer Simpson: Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?
Marge Simpson: That was your idea.
Bart Simpson: I think we should get a machine gun. We could use it to hunt game, spell out things, or ring in the new year!
Marge Simpson: Well, I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer.
HERB: How would you like to spend two thousand dollars to give a broken man a second chance?
Homer Simpson: Nah.
Marge Simpson: Homer, wait. Herb, what're you talking about?
HERB: Up-up-up-up. Not here. Come into the dining room. I want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world.
Homer Simpson: (WHINY) Twenty minutes?! (MOAN)
HERB: Okay. Now, before I tell you about my idea, I'd like to show you this.
Homer Simpson: (POINTING) It's drinking the water!
HERB: Take it easy, Homer. Now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed...
Homer Simpson: This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!
HERB: (PATIENTLY) No, Homer. That invention is out already. I'm just using it as an example.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) It's going back for more!
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED SOUND)
HERB: Homer, this is my invention.
HERB: Now, of course, with these blueprints you'll have to use your imagination.
Lisa Simpson: (COVERING FACE) Maggie! Maggie!
HERB: It's a baby translator. It measures the pitch, the frequency, and the urgency of a baby's cries. Then it tells whoever's around -- in plain English -- exactly what the baby is trying to say. Everything from "Change me" to "turn off that damn Raffi record."
Marge Simpson: (IMPRESSED) That's a very clever idea!
HERB: All I need is a couple thousand dollars to build a prototype. You'll have your money back in thirty days. I swear.
Lisa Simpson: I think we owe a debt to Unky Herb. He took us into his home and Dad destroyed him.
Bart Simpson: Dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother.
Homer Simpson: All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother.
HERB: Nope.
Homer Simpson: Okay, then just give me the drinking bird.
HERB: Now, let's see... What could you be trying to say? (CHECKING MAGGIE'S DIAPER) Nothing downstairs... You just took a nap...
HERB: (HOLDING NOSE) "I want to suck your nose."
HERB: Ooga booga! Ooga booga!
HERB: (WRITING ON CLIPBOARD) "I'm scared."
HERB: Hmm... the amplitude of the sine wave is insufficient for "Burp Me", and this saw-tooth formation is something I've never...
HERB: Eureka.
HERB: Now, I bet you're all wondering what lies under this sheet.
Bart Simpson: Not really. We peeked inside while you were in the john.
HERB: Oh. Well, here it is again. My "Baby Translator!"
Marge Simpson: (TOO BIG) Whoooa!!
HERB: Marge, you don't have to humor me.
Marge Simpson: Well, it's pretty ingrained.
HERB: What do you think, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks.
HERB: Homer, could you stop thinking about your ass!
Homer Simpson: I try, but I can't.
Herb Powell: (THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) Lavish attention on me and entertain me.
Marge Simpson: (GASPS) Maggie, you talked!
HERB: You see! It tells you exactly what's on the baby's mind.
Homer Simpson: (PHEW) Never mind.
Herb Powell: (THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) Where did you go?
Lisa Simpson: Peek-a-boo!
Herb Powell: (THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) Oh, there you are. Very amusing.
HERB: Well, Homer, now what do you think?
Homer Simpson: I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something.
Marge Simpson: Homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these.
Herb Powell: (THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) I have soiled myself. How embarrassing.
Homer Simpson: I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
Marge Simpson: Don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. He is your brother.
Homer Simpson: Well, when is he gonna act like it?

HERB: This is what you get, Homer. I forgive you. You can call me brother and I can do the same.
Homer Simpson: That's it?
HERB: That's it.
Homer Simpson: (SINCERELY) I see your point, brother.

Marge Simpson: (REMINDING HOMER) Homie, you do remember your promise to the children?
Homer Simpson: (CHEERFULLY) Sure do. (TO KIDS) When you're eighteen, you're out the door.
Lisa Simpson: No, Dad. You promised if Bart and I got C averages we could go to Kamp Krusty. And with no false modesty, (POINTS TO SELF) you're looking at one happy camper.
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS) Yeah. Well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. It now goes: D,B,A,C.
Homer Simpson: Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty.
Bart Simpson: But Dad...

Homer Simpson: You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy.
Bart Simpson: (CRYING) So I won't get to go to camp?
Homer Simpson: Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn't. But why should you pay for my mistake?
Bart Simpson: You mean I can go?
Homer Simpson: Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
Bart Simpson: Oh, Dad. You're the best father a boy could ever have!
Homer Simpson: Thanks son. (RUBBING BART'S HAIR) Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?

Marge Simpson: (SHARPLY) I'm sure you won't enjoy it. There's nothing about bowling in the play... Oh wait, there is.
Homer Simpson: Probably not much of it.
Marge Simpson: Why can't you be a little more supportive?
Homer Simpson: Because I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects.

Marge Simpson: We're talking about Bart.
Homer Simpson: Oh. That guy.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I think the problem here is discipline. If Bart does something wrong you should punish him.
Marge Simpson: Well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in.
Homer Simpson: (CHEERFUL) He's the boy you love to hate.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well, you've got to start being firm with him. I believe with persistent discipline even the poorest student can end up becoming... oh... say Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

Homer Simpson: But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present.
Marge Simpson: (EXASPERATED SIGH) Please, Homer. Why do I always have to be the bad guy?

Bart Simpson: (PATTING POCKET WITH TICKET CLEARLY VISIBLE) I got my ticket.
Kent Brockman: I'm here live in Korea to give you a first hand look at how American cartoons are made. But first, let's take a look back at the year 1928. A year when you might have seen Al Capone dancing the Charleston on top of a flagpole.
Kent Brockman: It was also the year of the very first Scratchy cartoon, entitled "That Happy Cat".
Homer Simpson: Sorry, but the punishment stands.
Kent Brockman: The film did very poorly. But the following year Scratchy was teamed up with a psychotic young mouse named Itchy. And cartoon history was made. Here's their first cartoon together: "Steamboat Itchy."
Itchy: Oh me, oh my!
Kent Brockman: During the war Itchy & Scratchy put their differences aside and teamed up to fight a bigger foe.
Kent Brockman: We'll be back with a real life Itchy & Scratchy. A rabid mouse in Boston who attacked and killed a small cat. (CHUCKLES)

Bart Simpson: Come on, go nuts.
Homer Simpson: Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?

Bart Simpson: Not bloody likely.

Bart Simpson: Dad, what's the point of this story?

Lisa Simpson: It wasn't that great.
Bart Simpson: Be honest.

Homer Simpson: Don't you think I know that?
Marge Simpson: Well, it's been two months. You laid down the law and I'm proud of you. But I think we've gotten through to him.
Homer Simpson: Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a "Mister Tight Buns" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen.
