Homer Simpson: What? Why? Oh, yeah. (FORCED POLITENESS) Hello Patty, hello Selma. How was your trip?
Marge Simpson: (READS) "Dear friends of the Simpson family: We had some sadness and some gladness this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new little cat, Snowball II...so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by herself. Lisa got straight A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all..."

Homer Simpson: Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas so much.
Homer Simpson: (GRUMBLING) ...Every year.
Marge Simpson: All right, children. Let me have those letters. I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole.
Bart Simpson: Oh, please. (TO LISA) There's only one fat guy that brings us presents and his name ain't Santa.
Marge Simpson: A pony? Oh, Lisa. You've asked for that for the last three years and I keep telling you Santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh. Can't you take a hint?
Lisa Simpson: But I really want a pony and I've been really, really good this year.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) Oh, dear. Maybe Bart is a little more realistic.
Marge Simpson: (SHOCKED) A tattoo!
Homer Simpson: A what!
Bart Simpson: Yeah, they're cool and they last the rest of the your life.

Patty Bouvier: Hello, Marge. It's Patty. Selma and I couldn't be more excited about seeing our baby sister for Christmas eve.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit, too.
Patty Bouvier: Somehow I doubt that Homer's excited. Of all the men you could have married, I don't know why you picked the one who's always so rude to us.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)

Homer Simpson: (GASPS) It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone.

Homer Simpson: Sorry, Barney. I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on Christmas eve.
Barney Gumble: Come on, Simpson. The dog's name is Whirlwind, ten to one shot. Money in the bank.
Homer Simpson: Uh-uh.
Bart Simpson: Ah, come on Dad, this can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's gonna happen to us.

Patty Bouvier: Oh, nothing dear. I'm just trashing your father.
Lisa Simpson: Well I wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have. Therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me. And I am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts.

Martin Prince: Mrs. Krabappel, isn't Bart supposed to face the window so he won't be tempted to look at his neighbor's paper?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: You're right, Martin. Bart?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Remember to visualize the complex problems. And relax. The test will start... NOW!
Bart Simpson: (QUIETLY, TO HIMSELF) At seven-thirty a.m. an express train traveling sixty miles an hour leaves Santa Fe bound for Phoenix, five hundred and twenty miles away.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (WHISPERING, TAPS HER HEAD) Shhhhh! Visualize it, Bart!
Bart Simpson: At the same time a local train traveling thirty miles an hour and carrying forty passengers leaves Phoenix bound for Santa Fe.
Bart Simpson: It's eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car.
Bart Simpson: An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off, but three times as many plus six get on.
Bart Simpson: Oof!
Bart Simpson: At the second stop, half the passengers plus two get off, but twice as many get on as got on at the first stop.
Conductor: Ticket, please.
Bart Simpson: (FRIGHTENED) I don't have a ticket.
Conductor: Come with me, boy.
Conductor: We've got a stowaway, sir.
Martin Prince: Twice the fare from Tucson to Flagstaff minus two thirds of the fare from Albuquerque to El Paso. (LAUGHS DEMONICALLY)
Bart Simpson: Yaaaaahhh!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Bart, there are students in this class with a chance to do well. Will you stop bothering them?
Martin Prince: He's not bothering me, Mrs. Krabappel. I'm finished. May I go outside and read under a tree?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Certainly, Martin.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: What are you looking at, Bart? Are those naughty dogs back again?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: You have twenty minutes, class.
(Springfield Elementary School Playground: ext. school playground - LATER)
Marge Simpson: He's a good boy now, and he's getting better, and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard.
Homer Simpson: That's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. (NOTICES THE PICTURE OF THE PRINCIPAL) Hey, look at this! "I am a weiner." (CHUCKLES) He sure is!
(Skinner's Office: int. principal skinner's office)
Secretary: (OVER INTERCOM) Mr. and Mrs. Simpson are here.
Seymour Skinner: Send them in.
Marge Simpson: Hello again, Principal Skinner.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) What have you done this time, boy?
Seymour Skinner: I caught your son defacing school property this morning. We estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and, frankly, we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?
Homer Simpson: Oh, no. He can't mean that.
Homer Simpson: My wife thinks you want me to pay for it.
Seymour Skinner: That was the idea.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Seymour Skinner: By itself something like this might not call for an extreme penalty...but this is not an isolated incident. Bart's behavior is unruly. He's frequently absent from school, then gives teachers pathetic excuse notes...that are obviously childish forgeries when compared to...
Seymour Skinner: Well, at any rate, it is my reluctant decision --
Secretary: (THRU INTERCOM) Mr. Skinner, Doctor Pryor is here to see you. He says it's urgent.
Seymour Skinner: (INTO INTERCOM) Send him in.
Rod #2: (FROM SCREEN) We're radioactive!
Seymour Skinner: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, this our district psychiatrist, Dr. J. Loren Pryor.
Homer Simpson: What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Oh, on the contrary. I have some very exciting news for all of us. This aptitude test we administered this morning has revealed that young Bart here is what we call a "gifted child".
Homer Simpson: A what?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Your son is a genius, Mr. Simpson.
Marge Simpson: Bart?
Homer Simpson: This lunkhead?
Seymour Skinner: Impossible.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: No, no, we're quite certain. The child is not supposed to know his own I.Q., of course, but, uh, you can see it's beyond the range of any doubt.
Homer Simpson: (AMAZED) Nine hundred and twelve?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh, no, you have it upside down. It's two hundred and sixteen.
Homer Simpson: (CRESTFALLEN) Oh.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: That's still amazingly high.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Tell me, Bart, are you ever bored in school?
Bart Simpson: Oh, you bet.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Um-hmmm... Ever feel a little frustrated?
Bart Simpson: All the time, sir.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh-huh. Do you ever dream of leaving your class to pursue your own intellectual development on an independent basis?
Bart Simpson: Wow, it's like you're readin' my mind, man.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: (TO PARENTS) A-ha... You see, when a child with Bart's intellect is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person, he's probably going to lash out in ways (PICKS UP BART'S FILES) like these.
Seymour Skinner: (ASIDE TO DR. PRYOR) I think we should re-test him.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: No, no, I think we should move him to another school.
Seymour Skinner: Oh. Better yet.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Bart, we'd like you to try a kind of school that doesn't rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers. (WAVES HIS HAND IN A DISMISSING FASHION) A school without walls. Where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to. Does that sound good, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Sign me up, Doc.
Homer Simpson: Come on, Bart, your mother's only trying to help. So go ahead and enjoy the show.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Excellent. We're all set, then. Here's all the information you need. (HANDS BART SOME LEAFLETS) Show up around nine-ish. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, congratulations once again.
Seymour Skinner: I think we're all in a mood to celebrate.
Homer Simpson: Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Well, genius-level intelligence is usually the result of heredity and environment...
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh... although, in some cases it's a total mystery.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN)
Bart Simpson: Aw, come on, Mom.
Marge Simpson: You look very intelligent, dear.
Bart Simpson: No way.
Homer Simpson: How 'bout a tie, son? Everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties.
Bart Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) You're stifling my creativity, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, boy.
Marge Simpson: Bart, this is a big day for you. Why don't you eat something a little more nutritious?
Homer Simpson: Nonsense, Marge! Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today.
Homer Simpson: It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. Lisa, maybe you should try some of this.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up.
Lisa Simpson: (TO BART, QUIETLY) I don't care what that stupid test says, Bart. You're a dimwit.
Bart Simpson: (QUIETLY, TO LISA) Maybe so, but from now on, this dimwit is on Easy Street.
(Homer's Car: EXT. HOMER'S CAR - MORNING)
Bart Simpson: No rush, Dad. Take the scenic route.
Homer Simpson: Gotcha!
(NEW SCHOOL: EXT. NEW SCHOOL)
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY)
Bart Simpson: Oh, no. Ties.
Homer Simpson: Don't worry son, you can have mine. Here, let me show you how to put on a tie.
Homer Simpson: The hook goes over the top and these things go in there.
Bart Simpson: Thanks, Dad.
Bart Simpson: You kissed me.
Marge Simpson: Nurturing your brilliant brain, so I got tickets to the opera tonight. Hurry up, get dressed! It starts at eight.
Homer Simpson: Well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, I think. Now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations. You may outsmart someone.
Ms. Melon: You must be Bart Simpson. I'm Ms. Melon (PRONOUNCED ME-LAN), your learning coordinator.
Ms. Melon: Let me say right at the start that we have one rule here: Make your own rules. If you feel sleepy, take a nap. If you get bored, feel free to take out a book and start reading.
Bart Simpson: What should I read, ma'am?
Ms. Melon: Why, anything you want, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Ohhh!
Ms. Melon: A comic book. How did this get mixed in here? We used it last week as a prop in a film we made about illiteracy.
Ms. Melon: Bart, these are the students who will share your work area. This is Ethan Foley.
Ethan Foley: O Memsahib Bart, Rabbi has memo.
Bart Simpson: What?
Ms. Melon: (WRITES ON THE BLACKBOARD) Ethan is very good with palindromes -- you know, sentences spelled the same backwards and forwards. And this is Sidney Swift.
Sydney: "Trab, ing norm doog."
Bart Simpson: What's your problem?
Ms. Melon: Oh, don't mind Sidney. He's just speaking in backwards phonetics today. He said "Good morning, Bart". And this is Cecile Shapiro.
Cecile Shapiro: Hi, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Cool. Hamsters! (TAPS ON CAGE) What are their names?
Cecile Shapiro: (LOOKS PUZZLED) Hamster number one has been infected with a staphylococci virus. Hamster number two is the control hamster.
Bart Simpson: Hi, li'l control hamster.
Ms. Melon: I wouldn't get too attached, Bart. We're dissecting him next week.
Ms. Melon: Discover your desks, people.
Ms. Melon: Now, let's all welcome the newest member of our collective experience, Bart Simpson.
Ms. Melon: And now we can continue our debate from yesterday. When we left off, Calvin and Tanya were arguing that free will is an illusion.
Bart Simpson: Oh, Mom! Not tonight.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you're going, too.
Ian: If you ask me, humankind has freedom, a freedom fraught with paradoxes. Freud shows how childhood shapes our subconscious mind, but this helps us to think for ourselves.
Ms. Melon: Very good, Ian. Does anyone else have an example of a paradox? (THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HANDS)
Ethan Foley: Without law and order, man has no freedom.
Cecile Shapiro: If you want peace, you must prepare for war.
Ms. Melon: Um-hmm, um-hmm... Well, it seems the smartest child in the class is also the quietest. Bart, what other paradoxes affect our lives?
Bart Simpson: Well... you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.
Ms. Melon: Well, I guess that would be a paradox, too. (CHUCKLES) Thank you, Bart.
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Whew!
Calvin: Tell you what, Bart! I'll trade you the weight of a bowling ball on the eighth moon of Jupiter from my lunch for the weight of a feather on the second moon of Neptune from your lunch.
Bart Simpson: Well, okay.
Calvin: There you go.
Sydney: I will trade you one thousand picoliters of my milk for four gills of yours.
Bart Simpson: Well, all right.
Sydney: Anything you say.
Ian: Uh, Bart, would you wager your cupcake against my...
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) Save your breath.
Ethan Foley: What do you think of the new kid?
Ian: A rather mediocre genius.
Calvin: Yes, not very bright at all.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING)
Homer Simpson: So, how was it?
Bart Simpson: Os-os.
Homer Simpson: What?
Bart Simpson: That's backwards for so-so.
Homer Simpson: Wow! What are you readin' there? (LOOKS) Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?
Homer Simpson: Tell you what: To celebrate your first day of genius school, whaddaya say we go out for a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?
Bart Simpson: All righty!
Marge Simpson: Bart, I feel so bad for going so many years without... uh... hmmm... What's that word where you encourage something to grow?
Homer Simpson: But I'm not a genius. Why should I suffer?
(Opera House: INT. OPERA HOUSE)

Marge Simpson: Shush.
Marge Simpson: Shhh!
Homer Simpson: Who's the lard butt?
Lisa Simpson: He's the bullfighter.
Bart Simpson: No way a bull is gonna miss a target that big, man.

Bart Simpson: It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
Homer Simpson: Is that one fat enough for you, son?
Homer Simpson: Let's go get a burger.
(CLASSROOM: INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING)
Ms. Melon: So Y equals R cubed over three, and if you determine the rate of change in this curve correctly, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
Ms. Melon: Well, don't you get it, Bart? Derivative D-Y equals three R squared D R over three, or R squared D R, or R D R R. Hardy-har-har! Get it?
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah. (A WEAK CHUCKLE)

Bart Simpson: Oh, no.
Homer Simpson: Well, I guess we don't have to do that.
Bart Simpson: Um, look Dad, I got something to tell you.
Homer Simpson: Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark.

Bart Simpson: Uh, nothin', Pop.
(NEW CLASSROOM: int. new classroom - later that morning)
Ms. Melon: I'm still trying to get you a lab partner, Bart. If we don't get any volunteers soon, I'll assign somebody. Say, what's that? It looks dangerous.

Bart Simpson: 'Course I do!
(SCHOOL BUILDING: ext. school building)

(OLD SCHOOL: int. old school - dr. pryor's office)
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Now, Bart, we want to emphasize that nobody's angry about this. We're... we're just concerned. When a young man with a two hundred sixteen I.Q. can't make a simple experiment work, well, it doesn't take a Bart Simpson to figure out that something's wrong. Tell me, is the class moving too slowly for you?
Bart Simpson: Lord, no.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Well then what can we do to make you happy?
Bart Simpson: I want to go back to my old class.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Oh, but, Bart, don't you remember the boredom... the ennui... the intellectual malaise?
Bart Simpson: Yeah, well, you know... kinda... but I was thinking I could go undercover.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Undercover? Bart, I'm intrigued. Go on.
Bart Simpson: Well, I could pretend I'm a regular dumb kid. You know... to study them, and all the stuff they do with each other. You know, see what makes them tick.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: I see... like Jane Goodall and the chimps.
Bart Simpson: Yeah.
Rod #1: (FROM SCREEN) Of course we're hot.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh-huh, this is most impressive, Bart. You write up your proposal while I talk to Principal Skinner.
Bart Simpson: Proposal?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: You know, outline your project, what you hope to achieve, what you'll require to do it.
Bart Simpson: Gotcha, man.
Bart Simpson: "My Proposal" by Bart Simpson. I want to pretend I am a regular dumb kid... period. By this I hope... oh no... for this I will... um... require... (SIGHS; ALOUD) Aw, man!
Bart Simpson: (SIGHS) "My Confession" by Bart Simpson. I am a regular dumb kid... period. I cheated on my intelligence test... period.

Bart Simpson: I'm not a genius, Dad.
Homer Simpson: What?
Bart Simpson: I cheated on the intelligence test. I'm sorry. But I just want to say that the past few weeks have been great. Me and you have done stuff together, you've helped me out with things, and we're closer than we've ever been. I love you, Dad, and I think if something can bring us that close, it can't possibly be bad.

(Park: ext. park - day)
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer. I am so proud of you.
Homer Simpson: (DOWN) Proud. Proud of what?
Marge Simpson: Well, everything. (GESTURING) Your dip sign, for instance. Now people won't be caught off-guard by that little (MAKES DIP GESTURE WITH HER HAND) in the road.
Homer Simpson: Ah, what a great family! But come on, we all know this is small potatoes. There is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together.
Lisa Simpson: What, Dad?
Homer Simpson: I'm talking about that!
Marge Simpson: You don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses?
Lisa Simpson: Wow!

Crowd: (CHANTING) Homer! Homer!
Homer Simpson: (INTO bullhorn) Thank you.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah!
Homer Simpson: (INTO bullhorn) Unlike most of you, I am not a nut. Just a good, honest American who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur.
(Burns's Office: INT. Montgomery Burns' Office)
C. Montgomery Burns: (SIGHS) Look at that man. He has the crowd in the palm of his hand. Haven't seen anything like it since Jolson. Who is he?
Waylon Smithers: (Hands Burns binoculars) That's Homer Simpson, sir. He used to work here in the plant, but we fired him for gross incompetence.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, so that's his little game. Get this Simpson character up here right now.
Waylon Smithers: But, Mr. Burns --
C. Montgomery Burns: I said, DO IT! NOW, DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: EXT. Power Plant)
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN) Our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I. Many of them, incompetent boobs. I know this because I have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say, this stinks!
Bart Simpson: Right on, Dad!
Waylon Smithers: Hey, hey, Simpson.
Waylon Smithers: Burns wants to talk to you, privately.

Homer Simpson: Same here.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson. I want you to rejoin our power plant family.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, no can do!
C. Montgomery Burns: Hear me out, Simpson. I don't want you to come back as a Technical Supervisor, or Supervising Technician, or whatever the hell you used to do. I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant.
Homer Simpson: Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about.
C. Montgomery Burns: The generous offer I'm making is good for exactly thirty seconds, Simpson.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah!
Homer Simpson: Hey! What's the problem here?
Homer Simpson: (THINKS) Me in charge of safety? This place could blow sky-high. (THEN) Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. (THEN) Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. (THEN) I can't let Marge support the family. (THEN) This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I...
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson! Time's up!
Homer Simpson: Umm... What the hey. I'll take the job.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent! Your first duty will be to step out on the (GESTURING) balcony and tell that crowd this plant is safe.
Homer Simpson: (GASP) What?
C. Montgomery Burns: Go on, Homer.
Lisa Simpson: Go, Dad!
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN) Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN) Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back.
Homer Simpson: I can't do it, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: You mean you're willing to give up a good job and a raise just for your principles?
Homer Simpson: Hmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. But that's the lug you're looking at. And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have crusading for safety. Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job.
C. Montgomery Burns: You're not as stupid as you look... or sound... or our best testing indicates.
C. Montgomery Burns: You've got the job. Now get to work.
Homer Simpson: I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.
(PLANT: ext. plant)
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN; SNIFFLING) Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us.
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN; COVERING) ...and I'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. The only reason I'm telling you this is I'm going to be leaving you.
Homer Simpson: But, don't worry. I've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!
Bart Simpson: Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad watch out!
Homer Simpson: Whoa! Easy! Don't drop me! Be careful.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - morning)

Bart Simpson: No, I don't!

Marge Simpson: (MURMUR OF ASSENT)
Homer Simpson: (INDICATING GELATIN) Are you sure that's enough? You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.
Marge Simpson: (FLATTERED) Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it. Once.

C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, please, please, don't fight. Just go out back and have a good time.

Bart Simpson: Bart.
Homer Simpson: Don't correct the man, Brat. (TO BURNS) Oh, Boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, for the love of Peter! That's all anybody brought. Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop. Well, toss it in the pile over there.
C. Montgomery Burns: And make yourselves at home.
Bart Simpson: Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself.
Homer Simpson: Why you, listen to me you...

Marge Simpson: Oh, I'm not much of a drinker.
Mrs. Long: (POINTING O.S.) Hey, isn't that your boy there, torturing the swans?

Homer Simpson: (GRUMBLES) You remember the rules from last year?
Bart Simpson: Yeah. Shut my mouth and let your boss win.
Bart Simpson: Hey!
Wife #1: I don't know who to love more. My son Joshua, who is captain of the football team, or my daughter Amber, who got the lead in the school play. Usually I use their grades as a tie-breaker, but they both got straight A's this term, so what's a mother to do?
Marge Simpson: Uh-huh. Well, uh... I sense greatness in my family.
Wife #2: Your family?
Marge Simpson: Well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there and if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average. (FINISHES DRINK; TIPSILY) I don't want to alarm anyone, but I think there's a li'l al-key-hol in this punch.

Lisa Simpson: Hey!
Homer Simpson: Look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. We've got to do better as a family. So tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV. We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family.

I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my French... but they act like savages! Did you see them at the picnic? Oh, of course you did. You're everywhere. You're omnivorous.

Homer Simpson: Whoops. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Well, if you had been paying attention, perhaps you would have noticed that your family sees you as a rather stern authority figure - an ogre, if you will.
Marge Simpson: Now, Doctor, that's not true.
Lisa Simpson: "Ogre" is such a strong word.
Bart Simpson: Right on, Doc. Another successful diagnosis.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Whoa! (CHUCKLE) Okay, you want to kill each other. That's good. That's healthy. There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict. All I ask is that you use my patented aggression therapy mallets.
Homer Simpson: Good idea.
Bart Simpson: All right!
Marge Simpson: (TROUBLED) I don't know...
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Okay, let's take another deep, cleansing breath.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. What's the point?
Bart Simpson: They'd work much better without the padding, Doc.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, no. That's not true.
Bart Simpson: See.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Ow! Gimme that.
(Bathroom: int. bathroom)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (MAD) Yes, well, that concludes this portion of our treatment.
Marge Simpson: Are we cured yet?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Don't be ridiculous. You will be cured, but it's going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods.
Homer Simpson: Unortho what?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Don't worry, I'll have plenty of time to explain while I warm up the electric generator.
(DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY: int. dr. monroe's laboratory - a little later)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Everyone comfy? Good. Now, don't touch any of those buttons in front of you, for a very important reason, i.e. you are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--
Homer Simpson: Arrrgh!
Bart Simpson: Just testing.
Homer Simpson: Why you...
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, Homer! Not yet!
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: You see, this is what is known as aversion therapy. When someone hurts you emotionally, you will hurt them physically, and gradually you will learn not to hurt each other at all. And won't that be wonderful, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (SEEMINGLY MOVED) Oh, yes, doctor.
Bart Simpson: Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson: Arrrgh!
Marge Simpson: Bart, how could you shock your little sister?
Bart Simpson: My finger slipped.
Bart Simpson: Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson: So did mine.
Marge Simpson: Bart! Lisa! Stop that.
Lisa Simpson: Arrrgh!
Homer Simpson: Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson: Arrrgh!
Marge Simpson: Arrrgh!

Marge Simpson: Gee, I thought we were making real progress.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, I'm sorry, you're not. Please, you've just got to go.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Doc! Your TV commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Oh but that was just... All right. (TO RECEPTIONIST) Get the money.
(Waiting Room: int. waiting room - a little later)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (HANDING THE MONEY TO HOMER) (INDECIPHERABLE COUNTING) five hundred. Here! Just go, and never tell anyone you were here.
Homer Simpson: Wow! Five hundred smackers!
Marge Simpson: Homer, how wonderful. Our first pleasant surprise.
Lisa Simpson: It's not the money as much as the feeling that we earned it.
Bart Simpson: You did it, Dad.
Marge Simpson: Excuse me, dear. Shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back?
Homer Simpson: That piece of junk? Forget it! We're going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
Bart Simpson: Yay!

Lisa Simpson: It's Mrs. Hoover's birthday!
Bart Simpson: You know, there are names for people like you.
Lisa Simpson: No there aren't.
Bart Simpson: Teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt kisser...
Homer Simpson: Bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing.
Bart Simpson: Huh?
Homer Simpson: Well, you see, boy. It never hurts to grease the wheels a little.
Lisa Simpson: I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad. I like my teacher.
Homer Simpson: Surely, Lisa. (To BART) You see how it works, Bart? (GESTURING WITH CUPCAKE) A cupcake here, a good grade there.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I get good grades 'cause I'm smart and I pay attention and I study hard.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, right, Lis. (TO BART) It's the three roads to success, Bart. Work, brains, and... (GESTURES WITH CUPCAKE)

Otto Mann: That's bad news, man.
Lisa Simpson: Here, Otto, I made an extra one for you.
Otto Mann: Oh, thanks, little lady.
Lisa Simpson: (PLEASED) You're welcome.
Bart Simpson: Better let me hold these, Lis.

Lisa Simpson: Tell me more.
Bart Simpson: (EXASPERATED GRUNT) Backscratcher! Foot licker! Honor student!
Lisa Simpson: (SMUGLY) You'll never get one now, Mr. Name-caller.
Bart Simpson: (THE VOICE OF REASON) All right, all right. Look. I'm sorry. I-I got upset. In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn't mean.
Lisa Simpson: You weren't thinking, were you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: I'm not a sniveling toad, am I?
Bart Simpson: Not really.
Bart Simpson: Does not.
Lisa Simpson: I'm not a little egg sucker, am I?
Bart Simpson: Of course not.
Lisa Simpson: Then what am I?
Bart Simpson: A beautiful human being.

Bart Simpson: So give her back those cupcakes before I knock your block off.
Lisa Simpson: Don't Bart! He's a friend of Nelson Muntz.
Weasel #1: Nelson, you're bleeding.
Nelson Muntz: Nah. This happens all the time. Somebody else's blood splatters on me.
Nelson Muntz: Hey, wait a minute. You're right. (TO BART) You made me bleed my own blood.
Bart Simpson: (SUDDENLY FRIGHTENED) Uh, it was an ACCIDENT, man. A terrible ghastly mistake! Ask anybody!

Homer Simpson: So, what's the problem, son?
Bart Simpson: (INTIMATE) I had a run-in with a bully.
Marge Simpson: A bully?!
Homer Simpson: Come on, Marge. I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa.
Marge Simpson: Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight to the principal about this.
Bart Simpson: I guess I could do that.
Homer Simpson: What? And violate the code of the school yard? I'd rather Bart died.
Marge Simpson: What on earth are you talking about, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (AMAZED AT HER IGNORANCE) The code of the School yard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see... Don't tattle... Always make fun of those different from you... Never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... Hmmm, what else... ?
Bart Simpson: I know. (COUGHS UP BASEBALL CAP)
Marge Simpson: Oh Homer, that's ridiculous. (GROANS) Bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding?
Bart Simpson: What do you mean, Mom?
Homer Simpson: (MYSTIFIED) Yeah, right! This ought to be good for a laugh.
Marge Simpson: Shh! This bully friend of yours... Is he a little on the chunky side?
Bart Simpson: Yeah, - he's pretty chunkified, all right.
Marge Simpson: Huh huh. And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either.
Bart Simpson: No. He's pretty dumb. He's in all the same special classes I am.
Marge Simpson: That's why he lashes out at the world.
Homer Simpson: Aw, Marge.
Marge Simpson: So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go.
Homer Simpson: Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi. Let's go, boy.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: Now here's that bully of yours. Show me your stuff.
Homer Simpson: No, no! Not like that! Like this!
Homer Simpson: See, that boy? You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he.
Bart Simpson: (DISBELIEVING) You mean I should fight dirty, Dad?
Homer Simpson: Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.
Bart Simpson: Amen.
Homer Simpson: So the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded...
Bart Simpson: (STARTING TO UNDERSTAND) Yeah!
Homer Simpson: And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
Bart Simpson: Gotcha.
Homer Simpson: And if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations.

Herman Hermann: Okay... The key to Springfield has always been Elm Street: The Greeks knew it. The Carthaginians knew it. Now you know it. First, you'll need a declaration of war.
Herman Hermann: That way everything you do will be nice and legal. (LOOKING OVER DOCUMENT) Okay, I can use this one from the Franco­ Prusssian War. I'll just change Otto von Bismark to read Bart Simpson and...

Lisa Simpson: I'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of its car. The Iowa farmer whose land has been taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats. The West Virginia coal miner, coughing up his...
Dewey Largo: Well, that's all fine and good, but Lisa, none of those unpleasant people are going to be at the recital next week.
Dewey Largo: Now, class. From the top. Five, six, seven...
(LUNCHROOM: int. lunchroom - later that day)
Lisa Simpson: Every day at noon a bell rings and they herd us in here for feeding time. And we sit around like cattle, chewing our cuds, dreading the inevitable...
Bart Simpson: (HOLLERING HAPPILY) Food fight!
JANEY: C'mon, Lees, what are you waiting for?
JANEY: Chuck that spaghetti!
Lisa Simpson: I choose not to participate.
(EXERCISE ROOM: int. EXERCISE ROOM - later that day)
Ms. Barr: Lisa, we are playing dodge ball here. The object of the game is to avoid the ball by weaving or ducking out of its path.
Lisa Simpson: In other words, to dodge the ball.
Ms. Barr: Listen, missy, just tell me why you weren't getting out of the way of those balls.
Lisa Simpson: I'm too sad.
Ms. Barr: Too sad to play dodge ball? That's ridiculous. Now, let's see some enthusiasm! Play ball!
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - afternoon)
Homer Simpson: Come on, come on. Let's go.
Bart Simpson: In the red trunks, with a record of forty-eight wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, Battling Bart Simpson. (WHISTLES) Whoopee! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh, correction, humiliating defeats -- all of them by knockout...
Homer Simpson: (QUIET DIGNITY) Must you do this every time?
Bart Simpson: ...Homer "The Human Punching Bag" Simpson. Boo! Boo! Hiss!
Bart Simpson: And Homer is down! (LAUGH) Three seconds, folks -- a new record!
Homer Simpson: Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on!
Homer Simpson: Okay. Here we go.
Bart Simpson: Yo, chump, you back again?
Homer Simpson: (GRUNTS) Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid!
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Ohhh... get out of the corner!
Marge Simpson: But they sent a note from school.
Homer Simpson: (CONCENTRATING) What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way.
Bart Simpson: I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. There's no way they can prove anything.
Marge Simpson: No, Bart. This note isn't about you.
Bart Simpson: It isn't? There must be some mistake.
Bart Simpson: Hey, you're right. This note's about Lisa.
Homer Simpson: Lisa?
Homer Simpson: (READING) "Lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad." Well, she doesn't look sad. (PEERING CLOSELY AT LISA) I don't see any tears in her eyes.
Lisa Simpson: It's not that kind of sad. I'm sorry, Dad, but you wouldn't understand.
Homer Simpson: Oh, sure I would, princess. I have feelings, too. You know, like "my stomach hurts" or "I'm going crazy". Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it?
Lisa Simpson: I'm just wondering, what's the point? Would it make any difference at all if I never existed? How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?
Homer Simpson: Well... eh... er...eh...
Homer Simpson: Come on, Lisa... ride the Homer horsey. Giddiyap! Whee! (chuckles)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs and I'll draw you a nice hot bath? That helps me when I feel sad.
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, Dad. I know you mean well.
Homer Simpson: (TO LISA) Thanks for knowing I mean well.
Bart Simpson: Gee, Homer. Looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands.
Homer Simpson: You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor!
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, I didn't do anything wrong.
Homer Simpson: In times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. Now hop to it, boy!
(LIVING ROOM: int. living room - a little later)
Bart Simpson: (GRUMBLES) Stupid Homer... (MUMBLES) Thinks he's so big... Stupid Homer...(MORE MUMBLING) Stupid Homer. I'll show him.
Bart Simpson: (MAD) Enjoy your bath?
Lisa Simpson: No. Not really.
Bart Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Oh. Too bad. Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub.
Homer Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: (TO MAGGIE) So typical of Bart. All he thinks about is himself.
Bart Simpson: Hey, don't say stuff like that about me to Maggie. She's on my side, anyway.
Lisa Simpson: Is not.
Bart Simpson: Is, too.
Lisa Simpson: Is not.
Bart Simpson: Is, too.
Lisa Simpson: Is not.
Bart Simpson: Is, too. Watch, I'll prove it. Maggie, come to the one you love best.
Lisa Simpson: (DRAGGED INTO IT) No, Maggie! (BECKONING) Come here, girl. Come to me.
Bart Simpson: Come on, Maggie. The choice is obvious.
Lisa Simpson: No, Maggie, don't go for the glitter. Look for substance.
Lisa Simpson: All right Maggie, just go to Bart.
Bart Simpson: Exactly, come to the one you love.
Homer Simpson: Oh, no, come on! Don't let that boy -- get out of the... Oh, no, not again! Don't. Don't. Don't. Great, get over. Oh, geeze.
Bart Simpson: Gee, Dad, you're really bad at this.
Homer Simpson: I am not. It's just that (LISA'S SAX IS HEARD) I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. (CALLING) Lisa! Lisa!
(Lisa's Bedroom: int. lisa's bedroom - night - continuous)
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) Lisa, what did I tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house?
Lisa Simpson: (SADLY) I was just playing the blues... (PAUSE) ...Dad.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy.
Lisa Simpson: No, that's okay, Dad. (SNIFFS) I'll just work on my fingering. Unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you.
Homer Simpson: (SINCERE) Let's hear it.
Homer Simpson: You just clack as loud as you want. Lis.
Lisa Simpson: I've got to find that sound.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson's house - continuous)
(Street: EXT. STREET - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT)
(Bridge: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT)
Lisa Simpson: That was beautiful. What's it called?
Bleeding Gums Murphy: It's a little tune that I call the "I Never Had An Italian Suit Blues."
(Simpson Master Bedroom: int. homer and marge's bedroom - night)
Jacqueline Bouvier: Wait, Margie. Before you go out that door, let's put our happy face on. Because people know how good a mommy you have by the size of your smile.
Homer Simpson: What th...
Bart Simpson: Put up your dukes, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
Homer Simpson: Bart, go easy on me. I'm your Dad.
Bart Simpson: I am going easy on you, but you're just so old and slow and weak and pathetic.
Homer Simpson: No, Bart, no.
Marge Simpson: Homer, wake up! Wake up! Oh my, here let me wipe off that drool.
Homer Simpson: You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life is when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So why are you still awake?
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa. I don't know, Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs attention, but all the while our little Lisa's becoming a young woman.
Homer Simpson: Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR) Good night, Homer.
(Bridge: ext. bridge - night)
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (AS SHE PLAYS) Now -- low B-flat.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Okay, Lisa -- altissimo register.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Very nice, very nice. I once ruptured myself doing that.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks, Mr. Murphy.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: My friends call me Bleeding Gums.
Lisa Simpson: Ew! How'd you get a name like that?
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Well, let me put it this way. You ever been to the dentist?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Not me. I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my life as it is.
Lisa Simpson: I have problems, too.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Well, I can't help you, kid. I'm just a terrific horn player with tons of soul. But I can jam with you.
Lisa Simpson: Okay.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (SINGS) OH I'M SO LONELY, SINCE MY BABY LEFT ME / I GOT NO MONEY, AND NOTHING IS FREE / OH I BEEN SO LONELY, SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN / ALL I GOT IS THIS RUSTY... THIS RUSTY OLD HORN.
Lisa Simpson: (SINGS) "I got a bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, she gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo / I'm the sa...dest kid in grade number two."
Bart Simpson: Aw come on, I'll cheer you up.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: You know, you play pretty well for someone with no real problems.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, but I don't feel any better.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: The blues isn't about feeling better. It's about making other people feel worse and making a few bucks while you're at it. Which reminds me, if you're ever in the neighborhood, I'm playing at a little club called the Jazz Hole...
Marge Simpson: Lisa, get away from that jazzman!
Lisa Simpson: But Mom, can't I... stay a little longer?
Marge Simpson: Come on, come on. We were worried about you. (TO MURPHY) Nothing personal. I just fear the unfamiliar.
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - the next day)
Newsman: (FROM TV) Today's fire raced through downtown Springfield gutting Symphony Hall, the Springfield Museum of Natural History, the Springfield Arts Center...

Homer Simpson: Oh, no, Marge!
(KITCHEN: int. kitchen)
Homer Simpson: Marge, are you all right?
Marge Simpson: No, I'm very upset.
Homer Simpson: Then you've heard. Oh, God. What are we doing to do? The lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!
Marge Simpson: I'm upset about Lisa.
Homer Simpson: Oh. Me, too.
Bart Simpson: Me three. What are we talking about?
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: Do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah. Easy.
Marge Simpson: You do love her, don't you?
Bart Simpson: (MUTTERS) Oh, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Well you do, don't you?
Bart Simpson: Don't make me say it. I know the answer, you know the answer, he knows the answer, let's just drop it. Okay?
Marge Simpson: Okay, Bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. Be nice to your sister.
Bart Simpson: Okey-dokey.
Marge Simpson: Go on, Bart. No time like the present.
(FOYER: int. foyer)
Bart Simpson: Hi, man.
Lisa Simpson: I don't want your pity.
Lisa Simpson: How?
Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Yeah! Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.
Bart Simpson: (THRU PHONE) Is Jacques there?
Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Who?
Bart Simpson: (THRU PHONE) Jacques. Last name Strap.
Moe Szyslak: Hold on. (CALLS OUT) Uh..Jacques Strap! Hey, guys, I'm looking for a Jacques Strap!
Barflies: (CHUCKLE)
Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) What -- oh! Wait a minute -- Jacques Strap? It's you, isn't it? You cowardly little runt. When I get hold of you I am gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house)
Bart Simpson: Where's your sense of humor, man?
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, you'll be late for band practice. Let's go.
(Noiseland Arcade: ext. video arcade - day)
Homer Simpson: Gimme some quarters. (COVERING) I'm doing my laundry.
Cashier: (OVER MICROPHONE; SARCASTIC) Yeah, right.
Homer Simpson: (LOW) Where's the video boxing?
Cashier: (OVER MICROPHONE) It's over there in the corner, but if I were you, I really would use those quarters for laundry.
Homer Simpson: (RE: CHAMP) Hey, that kid's pretty good.
Boy Onlooker: Good? Are you kidding? Over two thousand fights, and he's still on his original quarter.
Champ: Okay? Who's next?
Kids: (WAVING QUARTERS) Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!
Homer Simpson: (TOWERING OVER CROWD WITH HIS BAG OF QUARTERS) No, me! No, Me!
Homer Simpson: Listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do?
Champ: I don't think so.
Homer Simpson: Aw, come on.
Champ: I'll tell you what, I'll do it if you bark like a dog.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) You little... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
Champ: (LAUGHING) You got yourself a deal, Fido.
(Noiseland Arcade: int. arcade - sometime later)
Champ: Well, looks like you're all out of quarters, old man.
Homer Simpson: That's okay. With the tips you've given me, I'm going to pound the tar out of a certain little smarty pants tonight. (CHUCKLES)
Woman: (TO CHAMP) Howie! I thought I told you to stop wasting your money in this stupid place.
Champ: Uh-oh. Sorry, Mom.
Woman: And you! A man of your age! You should be ashamed of yourself!
Homer Simpson: Excuse me. I think I hear my wife calling.
(Marge's Car: int. marge's car - day)
Lisa Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT)
Marge Simpson: Now, Lisa, listen to me. This is important. I want you to smile today.
Lisa Simpson: But I don't feel like smiling.
Marge Simpson: Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. It's what shows up on the surface that counts. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you... and happiness will follow.
Marge Simpson: Come on. You can do better than that.
Marge Simpson: Ah, that's my girl.
Lisa Simpson: I feel more popular already.
(Springfield Elementary School Yard: ext. school yard - continuous)
Ralph Wiggum: Hey, nice smile.
Lisa Simpson: (BRAVELY) Thanks.
Stan: Hey! What are you talking to her for? She's just going to say something weird.
Lisa Simpson: (THROUGH CLENCHED SMILING TEETH) Not me.
Ralph Wiggum: You know, I used to think you were some sort of a brainiac, but... I guess you're okay.
Lisa Simpson: (THROUGH SMILE) Uh-huh.
Stan: Hey, why don't come over to my house after practice? You can do my homework.
Lisa Simpson: Okay.
Marge Simpson: (Murmurs OF annoyance)
Dewey Largo: Five minutes, people. Five minutes. Now, Miss Simpson, I hope we won't have a repeat of yesterday's outburst of unbridled... creativity.
Marge Simpson: (Murmur OF extreme annoyance)
Lisa Simpson: No, sir.
Lisa Simpson: Wow, Mom.
Dewey Largo: So that's where she gets it.
Marge Simpson: (TRULY DISTRAUGHT) Lisa, I apologize to you. I was wrong. I take it all back. Always be yourself. You want to be sad, honey, be sad. We'll ride it out with you. And when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. From now on, let me do the smiling for both of us.
Lisa Simpson: Okay, Mom.
Marge Simpson: I said you could stop smiling, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: I feel like smiling.
Bart Simpson: (BORED) I'm going to knock you out one more time and that's it. This is getting boring, man.
Homer Simpson: (COYLY) Just try not to kill me too hard, son. Heh-heh-heh.
Bart Simpson: Whoa!
Homer Simpson: Kid, tonight's not your night.
Bart Simpson: All right, man. You asked for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.
Homer Simpson: Oh! Oh! Block it.
Bart Simpson: Wha' the...
Homer Simpson: (GRUNT; CHUCKLE) Uh-oh. You missed me.
Homer Simpson: Ha ha! I got you. Don't try that. I got ya. I'll block you. (IMITATING RING ANNOUNCER) And the crowd is on its feet as Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill.
Marge Simpson: Boys, I'd like your attention, please.
Homer Simpson: Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment.
Homer Simpson: Bart-the-bloody-pulp Simpson is on the ropes. He's hoping I'll put him out of his misery. Well, you're in luck, Bart, here comes my right.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Oh, noooo!
Homer Simpson: My game! My game! I coulda beat the boy! Marge, how could you? I was so close.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game.
Bart Simpson: You're right, Mom. I'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing.
Homer Simpson: (EXASPERATED GRUNT)
Marge Simpson: Oh, calm down, Homer. Lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family.
(JAZZ HOLE NIGHTCLUB: int. jazz hole nightclub)
Bleeding Gums Murphy: This next song was written by a friend of mine, one of the great little ladies of jazz.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (SINGS) "I got this bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo."
Homer Simpson: What?
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (SINGS) "I'm the saddest kid in grade number two."
(Simpson Front Yard: EXT. SIMPSON'S FRONT YARD - SATURDAY MORNING)
Bart Simpson: (GRUNTS WITH EXERTION) Rusty old hunk of junk.
Rod Flanders: (VERY FRIENDLY) Howdy, Bart. Hot enough for ya?
Bart Simpson: (GRUMBLING TO HIMSELF) Shut up, Flanders. Hey dad, how come we can't get a decent mower like the Flanders?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Just be happy with what you got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanderses.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS)
Ned Flanders: How do you like my new wheels, Simpson?
Bart Simpson: (UNRESERVEDLY) Wow, man! What an RV!
Homer Simpson: Bart! (TO FLANDERS) I suppose it has..uh..various features?
NED: It's got everything! Microwave, dishwasher, big-screen TV, deep fryer, and... see up there on the roof?
Homer Simpson: (CROAKING) A satellite dish!
Ned Flanders: Yes indeedilly-doodily.
Homer Simpson: But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do.
Ned Flanders: Simple, Simpson. Credit.
Homer Simpson: Oooh! Credit.
(Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us): ext. bob's rv roundup (FORMERLY RVS Я US) - A LITTLE LATER)
Cowboy Bob: Thank you God. Heh, heh. (CLEARS THROAT) May I help you?
Marge Simpson: (QUICKLY) We're just browsing, thank you.
Homer Simpson: I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?
Cowboy Bob: Yes, I do. That would be... the Ultimate Behemoth.
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED) Where is it?
Marge Simpson: Homer.
Cowboy Bob: We're standing in its presence. Behold! Isn't she... Look at this thing...
Cowboy Bob: Can you believe it? Man built this. It's a vehicle.
Homer Simpson: (BABBLES SPEECHLESSLY)
Bart Simpson: Does it have its own satellite dish, sir?
Cowboy Bob: You can tell your son, it has its own satellite. The VanStar One launched last February, just for this thing. That's all.
Bart Simpson: Oh man!
Marge Simpson: I'm not sure that we can afford...
Homer Simpson: (EAGERLY) Does it have a deep fryer?
Cowboy Bob: It has four of them. One for each part of the chicken.
Marge Simpson: I don't think we can afford this, Homer.
Salesman: Let's worry about that later. C'mon let's take a tour. Want to? C'mon.
(INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH: int. inside the ultimate behemoth - continues)
Bart Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Aye carumba!
Lisa Simpson: This is better than our house!
Homer Simpson: Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED) It all seems so expensive...
Homer Simpson: Hey, how much is it?
Cowboy Bob: You're a man of convict... You just wanted to ask that and blurted it out. Didn't you?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, how much is it?
Cowboy Bob: Well, first of all, I want you to know, I like your face.
Homer Simpson: You do?
Cowboy Bob: Really. I really do. I'm not just saying that. I mean it. You've got color in there. You're not Roman are you?
Homer Simpson: No.
Cowboy Bob: You look like a God, sort of. Why don't we step into the credit office, Zeus? (CHUCKLING) Hey your dad's just gonna come in here and work it out. Then you'll drive home in this.
(INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE: int. inside credit office - a few minutes later)
Cowboy Bob: I'm not gonna quote you a price until I check your credit rating. Lemme. I want to make myself clear on this. This is a formality. If you're saying to me, Bob, is this guy good for it? I say, yes. I don't check this machine. But I don't own the place. Even though my name's up there. Long story. But that doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to run it through the computer.
Homer Simpson: Is that a good siren? Am I approved?
Cowboy Bob: You ever known a siren to be good? Ha! No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. It's a bad siren. That's the computer in case I went blind telling me, sell a vehicle to this fellow and you're out of business. That's what the siren says.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Cowboy Bob: It seems the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range. And wee bit is me being polite. You couldn't afford this thing if you lived to be a million.
Homer Simpson: Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? (SADLY) I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob.
Cowboy Bob: Take it easy there. Don't ruin this feeling I'm getting from you. Perhaps I can show you something a little more... you.
(BACK OF THE RV LOT: EXT. BACK OF THE RV LOT - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER)
Cowboy Bob: Well, what do you think?
Marge Simpson: Used, isn't it?
Cowboy Bob: Mr. Simpson, you're never gonna own a better RV. And I don't mean that in a good way. I mean literally, buddy, this is it for you. You know, it's this or a wagon.
Homer Simpson: How much do you want for it?
Cowboy Bob: This is for you? This is yours? The price I'm quoting you? You're not gonna hand it to someone else? 'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for you, not for someone else... someone else, I'm doubling this.
Homer Simpson: I swear it Bob.
Cowboy Bob: This is you and me?
Homer Simpson: Yeah!
Cowboy Bob: In other words, two months from now I see this vehicle, your head's in that window?
Homer Simpson: On my honor.
Cowboy Bob: Three-fifty a month.
Homer Simpson: Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be alright if I conferred with my family?
Cowboy Bob: Mr. Simpson, if you have to go talk it over with those humans out there, then, there's something wrong with all of us. You look like a man who is able to make a decision or I wouldn't be wasting my... See that man right over there?
Homer Simpson: Yeah!
Cowboy Bob: He's buying this. Did you know that?
Homer Simpson: No.
Cowboy Bob: Called me two minutes before you came in, said, 'Save the little one, I'm coming down'. Here he is. Now, do you want it or not?
Homer Simpson: All right. All right! I'll take it.
Cowboy Bob: Best decision you're ever gonna make. You're gonna... This is gonna change your life.

Homer Simpson: (SCOFFING) Pfft. Maps. (SNORTS)
Marge Simpson: Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions?
Homer Simpson: Don't worry. This is an all-terrain vehicle.
Marge Simpson: My feet are getting wet!
Homer Simpson: Ah, come on. We're going back to nature.

Bart Simpson: You mean like we just did?
Homer Simpson: (RE MAGGIE) Will somebody help her?
Lisa Simpson: Look, Maggie! Birdies!
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer. What are we going to do?
Homer Simpson: Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
(The Girls' Campsite: ext. the girls' campsite - continuous)
DOLPH: Five finger discount, man.
Homer Simpson: Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings.
Homer Simpson: (SADLY TO HIMSELF) What am I going to do? I've murdered us all.
Homer's Canyon Echo: (LOUDLY) I've murdered us all... us all.. us all... us all.

Homer Simpson: Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax.
Lisa Simpson: (CALLING AFTER THEM) Remember, Dad. The handle of the Big Dipper points to the North Star.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods.
Lisa Simpson: Should Maggie be going with them, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Oh, I don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands, Lisa.
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS) There aren't any dangerous animals in this forest are there, Dad?
Homer Simpson: Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.
Bart Simpson: It's a deal.
Homer Simpson: And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Bart Simpson: (WORRIED) Right.
Homer Simpson: (PANIC) A rattler!
Bart Simpson: (PETRIFIED) I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not...
Homer Simpson: Run, you fool!

Homer Simpson: Through here, boy. Back to civilization.
Bart Simpson: How do you know?
Homer Simpson: When you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. It becomes natural. Like a third sense.

Homer Simpson: Plemk heh feh.
Newsman: (OVER CURSES) Now the naturalist who took these absolutely extraordinary pictures was most impressed by the creature's uncivilized look, its foul language, and most of all its indescribable stench.
Newsman: A popular supermarket tabloid has offered a reward of $5,000 to anyone who brings in the creature alive. Naturally, we'll have more on this story as soon as it develops. We now return you to the President's address, already in progress.

Homer Simpson: Can I have some apple sauce?
Tv Announcer #2: Specialists from around the world have gathered at the Springfield Primate Institute for a firsthand examination of the controversial creature. They are now ready to announce their findings.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished colleagues, after extensive biological and anatomical testing, I regret to announce that the evidence we have is inconclusive. This... thing may or may not be human.

Homer Simpson: Oh no, no. We stink, we stink!
Marge Simpson: Homer! Were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over?

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: And now I'd like to begin today's sermon which I have entitled, "Gambling, the 8th Deadly Sin." Today is Sunday, the Lord's day and yet, at this very moment, millions of Americans are not in the Lord's house. They're in their own house worshipping a false idol, professional football. Oh Lord...

Marge Simpson: No! Look, I don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids. Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in Sunday school today?
Lisa Simpson: The answers to deep theological questions..
Bart Simpson: Yeah. Among other things, apes can't get into heaven.
Homer Simpson: What! Those cute little monkeys? That's terrible. Who told you that?
Bart Simpson: Our teacher.
Homer Simpson: I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?
Bart Simpson: Ah, cool, man. Space Mutants 4. Drop me off! Drop me off!
Marge Simpson: No way, Jose.

Homer Simpson: You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... (GASP) Oh, oh.
C. Montgomery Burns: Look, there it is! The head!
Krusty the Clown: Kill him!
(Street: EXT. STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT)
Krusty the Clown: We know this part.
Bart Simpson: Oh yeah, right...
(Park: ext. park)
Bart Simpson: Well, that's my story. And if you still want to tear apart this young Sunday school student as he stands on the brink of salvation, I await your wrath.
Mob: Oohhh!
Krusty the Clown: Somehow I don't feel like killing anymore.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Neither do I.
Bart Simpson: Dad?
Bart Simpson: Forgive me, sir.
Jebediah Springfield: No problem, Bart.
Seymour Skinner: Look. It's glorious
Otto Mann: It's beautiful, man.
C. Montgomery Burns: I love you, Smithers.

Lisa Simpson: Maybe one more.
Lisa Simpson: I hope she likes the presents we got her.
Patty Bouvier: (LOW) Do you know the Heimlich Maneuver?
Bart Simpson: Well, I know she'll like mine. Who wouldn't like a bottle of real French perfume?
Bart Simpson: All the way from Gay Paree. Four bucks, plus tax.
Lisa Simpson: Well, I think she's gonna like my hand-made birthday card better.
Bart Simpson: Whoa, big deal... dry macaroni... spray paint and glue. Whoopee!
Bart Simpson: (WHISTLES)
Bart Simpson: Dibs! First dibs, I get to lick the beaters.

Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Huh? Whuh?
Lisa Simpson: Here's your birthday breakfast!
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED) Well, isn't this nice?
Homer Simpson: My birthday?
Lisa Simpson: No!
Homer Simpson: It's my birthday? What did I get? I love birthdays.
Marge Simpson: (A LITTLE COLDLY) No, Homer. It's mine.
Bart Simpson: You don't even know your own wife's birthday?
Homer Simpson: (PANIC RAPIDLY SETTING IN) Of course I know! Sure! (TO MARGE) You really thought I forgot, didn't you?
Bart Simpson: Oh, right. What'd you get her, Dad?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, what'd you get?
Homer Simpson: (STALLING) Huh... a very thoughtful gift. But it's a surprise. (STRETCHING) You know, it's such a beautiful morning, I think I'll take a little stroll around the block.
Lisa Simpson: I think he forgot, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Umm-hmm.
(Springfield Mall: ext. SPRINGFIELD mall - a few minutes later)

Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) Oh, Marge. He never gets you anything you want. He always gets something for himself.
Selma Bouvier: (TO PATTY) Like the tackle box.
Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) Remember when he got you the tackle box?
Selma Bouvier: (TO PATTY) And Connie Chung.
Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) And when he "surprised" you with the Connie Chung calendar?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) I'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.

Selma Bouvier: Umm-hmm.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - foyer - a little later)
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Be right there.
Marge Simpson: Homer, we're having dinner tonight at the Singing Sirloin.

Bart Simpson: You're welcome, Mom.
Patty Bouvier: (TO MARGE) Thirty-four years old.
Selma Bouvier: (LOW, TO MARGE) Time enough to start over with a new man.
Patty Bouvier: (LOW, TO MARGE) Someone who eats with his mouth shut.
Homer Simpson: What's that, Patty?
Patty Bouvier: Nothing. Finish your steak. (LOW) Look at him wolf down that gristle.
Barney Gumble: Wow!
Bart Simpson: Does not.
Lisa Simpson: Does, too.
Bart Simpson: Does not.
Lisa Simpson: Then how comes she's not putting on any of your perfume?
Bart Simpson: Yeah. Hey, Mom. How come you're not putting on any of my perfume?
Marge Simpson: Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) I-I'm saving it... for a special occasion.
Bart Simpson: What the hell are you talking about? There's gallons of it.
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: But this occasion is already so special if we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special.
Bart Simpson: Gotcha. (TO LISA) I told you she liked mine better.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, brother.
Homer Simpson: (AMIABLY) Hold on! Hold on now! Your mother hasn't opened my present yet.

Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Whoop! Don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. Beauty, isn't she?
Marge Simpson: Well, it's hard for me to judge (ANGRILY) since I've never bowled in my life.
Homer Simpson: (PLAYFUL) Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does.
(Simpson Master Bedroom: INT. Marge & homer's BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT)
Homer Simpson: You always say we should talk. I'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. But I'm going to stop in a second. So, please say something back, Marge, please. I'm gonna stop talking... now.
Marge Simpson: You bought that bowling ball for you, not for me.
Homer Simpson: What? No...
Marge Simpson: The holes were drilled for your fingers.
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could I?
Marge Simpson: You never intended for me to use that ball.
Homer Simpson: Well, if that's how you feel, I'll take it back.
Marge Simpson: You can't take it back. You had your name engraved on it.
Homer Simpson: So you'd know it's from me!
Marge Simpson: (GRIM) Homer, I'm keeping the ball. For myself.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm. I'll just use my ball.
Homer Simpson: (TAKEN ABACK) What? But you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.
Marge Simpson: (GRIM) I'm keeping it and I'm going to use it. Thank you for the present, Homer.

Counter Guy: Over there.
Marge Simpson: Thank you.
Counter Guy: Hey, wait, wait a minute. You're gonna need a lane.
Marge Simpson: No, thanks. I'm just here out of spite.
Counter Guy: Can't bowl without a lane.
Marge Simpson: Hm. Well... all right.
Counter Guy: Okay, here you go. You keep score on this. What size shoes you wear?
Marge Simpson: (PRIMLY) Never you mind.
Counter Guy: (PATIENT) Can't wear street shoes on the lanes. You gotta wear bowling shoes. What size, please?
Marge Simpson: (SOFTLY) Thirteen. Double A.
Counter Guy: Thirteen double A. (WHISTLES)
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Counter Guy: This is the closest I've got.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)

Marge Simpson: (TO HERSELF) A little warm and moist. (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR)
Jacques: (TO GROUPIES; THICK ACCENT) So -- one hundred and twenty pins later, I am the better man.
Marge Simpson: (TO HERSELF) I don't see what he's doing that's so different from what I'm doing.
Marge Simpson: (EMBARRASSED) Oh!
Marge Simpson: I'm awfully sorry.
Jacques: Entirely my fault. (PAUSE) It is nice to meet you... (LOOKS AT HER BALL)... Homer.
Marge Simpson: (FLUSTERED) Oh, no, no. Homer is my... ball's name. I'm Marge.
Marge Simpson: (SLIGHT SURPRISED GASP)
Jacques: Your fingers are so slender, so feminine. They are far too tapered for the ball you are using. You need something lighter, more delicate. Here, use my ball.
Marge Simpson: No... no, thank you, Mr... uh... (LOOKS AT THE NAME ON HIS BALL)... Brunswick.
Jacques: Call me Jacques.
Marge Simpson: Jacques.
Jacques: Marge.
Jacques: (PHILOSOPHICAL) As you wish. Many people have senseless attachments to heavy, clumsy things such as this "Homer" of yours.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm.
Jacques: May I ask you a bold question?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Jacques: You've never bowled before?
Marge Simpson: Never.
Jacques: No?
Marge Simpson: No.
Jacques: Then I will teach you.
Marge Simpson: Oh, I don't want to trouble you.
Jacques: Not at all. I am a professional. Roll the ball for me, Marge. Let me see your form.
Marge Simpson: All right. But I'm not very good.
Marge Simpson: I can hit that one pin all right. But the rest of them don't even wobble.
Jacques: I can help you, Marge. Pick up the ball. Pick up Homer. Pick him up.
Marge Simpson: Oh!
Jacques: Now, throw!
Marge Simpson: But...
Jacques: Throw, damn you!
Marge Simpson: (GASPS) You're a very good teacher!
Jacques: Yes, I am a very good teacher and I can teach you everything. I can tell you what the little arrows on the wood floor mean. Which frame is the beer frame. I bet you don't know how to make a five-seven-ten split, do you, Marge?
Marge Simpson: No.
Jacques: But first of all, you yell.. the eight pin is a cop.
Marge Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Jacques: Let it out, Marge. Laugh loud. Laugh out loud. You'll lose weight.
Marge Simpson: Oh, that's very funny.
Jacques: Feels good.
Marge Simpson: Oh, dear, I didn't realize there was so much to this game. What do you charge for lessons?
Jacques: (LIKE CHARLES BOYER) Twenty-five dollars.
Marge Simpson: Twenty-five dollars!
Jacques: It's a forty-dollar value.
Marge Simpson: Oh. Well... all right. When do we start?
Jacques: We have already begun.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - continuous)
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) Now this is living, eh, kids? Hot pizza... the food of kings.
Eugene Fisk: I love you, Dad.
Lisa Simpson: Don't be scared, Dad. It's not so hard taking care of us.
Homer Simpson: (LAUGHS) Lisa, I'm not scared. I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. (LONG BEAT AS THEY EAT) Does the time always drag like this?
(Barney's Bowlarama: int. bowling alley - continuous)
Jacques: (SENSUOUS) First you must get to know your lane. Feel the slickness. Feel the satiny finish. Caress it. Experience it. Quite smooth, isn't it?
Marge Simpson: Hm, very smooth.
Jacques: Smooth?
Marge Simpson: Yes, very.
Jacques: Yes?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Jacques: Yes.
Marge Simpson: Smooth.
Jacques: Smooth?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Jacques: Yes. You could eat off of it.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm.
Jacques: You hungry?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Jacques: (CALLING OFFSTAGE) Four onion rings!
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - a little later)
Lisa Simpson: Mm! Delicioso!
Bart Simpson: (LICKING HIS FINGERS) My compliments to the delivery boy.
Homer Simpson: Okay. We've eaten, and eaten well. Now, what else do we have to do? Well, let's check the list your mom left us.
Homer Simpson: Eat, mm-hm.
Homer Simpson: Ooh. Clean up. Now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in.
Homer Simpson: All right, we're clean. Now we'll... (CHECKS LIST) put Maggie to bed.

Homer Simpson: (HALF ASLEEP) Ahhh... ahhh... Oh, how was bowling?
Marge Simpson: It's a very challenging hobby.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES SLEEPILY) Sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing.
Marge Simpson: Umm-hmm. But I think I'll do much better tomorrow night.
Homer Simpson: Oh? You're going back?
(Kwik-E-Mart: ext. Kwik-E-Mart)
Marge Simpson: Well, sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again?
Homer Simpson: (CONFUSED) Uh, no, I don't mind.
Marge Simpson: Good night, Homer.
Homer Simpson: 'Night.
(Barney's Bowlarama: int. bowling alley - next night)
Jacques: It is for you.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Jacques! It fits. You got it in my size and it has my name on it. It's really for me.
Jacques: Seventeen fifty. Enjoy it my darling.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - late that night)
Jacques: (HUMMING) Here we are.
Marge Simpson: You didn't have to drop me off.
Jacques: But I wanted to. Marge... Do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight?
Marge Simpson: Oh, Jacques, I'm a married woman.
Jacques: (TORTURED) I know, I know. My mind says stop, but my heart and my hips cry proceed.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Jacques: Marge, darling, I-I want to see you tomorrow. Not at Barney's Bowl-A-Rama. Away from the thunderous folly of clattering pins. Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
Marge Simpson: What's brunch?
Jacques: You'd love it. It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end. You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal.
Marge Simpson: I don't think so.
Jacques: Marge, darling, there are ten pins in my heart. You've knocked over eight. Won't you please pick up that spare?
Marge Simpson: (A-FLUTTER) Oh! Oh! (QUICKLY) Well, all right.
Homer Simpson: Marge?
Marge Simpson: What, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (DEFEATED) Nothing.
(Simpson Foyer: int. simpson foyer - morning)
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh. School bus.
Marge Simpson: Here you go, kids. Special lunches. Lots of good things for growing bodies and some treats just for fun.
Bart Simpson: Whoa. Aye carumba!
Lisa Simpson: Are you going bowling again tonight, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Hm, yes, I am, as a matter of fact. Here's more treats. But don't worry, your dad will take care of dinner.
Bart Simpson: Mmm. Wednesday -- hoagie night.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Lisa. My darling little Lisa.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Bart. My special little guy.
(School Bus: int. school bus)
Bart Simpson: Mmmm. Great lunches, eh, Lis?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, Bart, don't you see? This is what psychologists call over-compensation. Mom is racked with guilt because her marriage is failing.
Bart Simpson: Hey, don't rock the boat, man. Whatever it is, we're making out like bandits.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I read about what happens to kids whose parents no longer love and cherish each other. They go through eight separate stages. Right now, I'm in Stage Three, fear. You're in Stage Two, denial.
Bart Simpson: No, I'm not.
Lisa Simpson: Yes, you are.
Bart Simpson: No, I'm not.
Lisa Simpson: Yes, you are.
Bart Simpson: Am not, am not, am not!
Lisa Simpson: (A LITTLE FRIGHTENED) I stand corrected.
(Coffee Shop: int. coffee shop - brunch time)
Jacques: Mimosa?
Marge Simpson: I'm a married woman. Please don't call me that.
Jacques: (LAUGHING) No, no, no, no, no. Mimosa is the name of the drink. It's orange juice and champagne. You're so wonderful that you thought it was something offensive.
Marge Simpson: Oh. Well, thank you.
HELEN: Marge! Marge Simpson! You remember me, don't you? I'm Helen Lovejoy, the gossipy wife of the minister.
Marge Simpson: Oh... yes, hello, Helen.
HELEN: Well, I had just finished eating and was about to leave when I looked over this way and said to myself, "Why, isn't that Marge Simpson over there? Having brunch with a man who isn't her husband?" And I just had to come over and say hello.
Marge Simpson: We're... uh...
HELEN: Oh, don't squirm on my account.
Jacques: I am giving her a bowling lesson, thank you.
Jacques: Now, Marge. Uh, the pins on the three-seven-ten split would be here. We'll make this little piece of food the ball. The ball's bigger, you know that...
Marge Simpson: Hmm-hmm.
Jacques: But for food, this is a good ball.
HELEN: Well, 'bye-bye. See you in church on Sunday, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Helen.
Jacques: Goodbye, Helen.
Mr. Fisk: I love you, son.
Jacques: You have a lovely friend, there. Let's hope something runs over her.
Marge Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Jacques: Your laughter is like music to me. But if you laugh at what I say next I will die, for I am about to say something very serious... perhaps shocking. Marge, my darling, I want you to meet with me again.
Marge Simpson: That doesn't shock me.
Jacques: Away from prying eyes. Away from the Helens of the world. At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace.
Jacques: (LIKE "THE CONTINENTAL") I've been waiting for you. Come in, my captivating one.
Jacques: May I have this dance?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Marge Simpson: You certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
Jacques: (LAUGHING) I like you so much. They're not for bowling. You are so naive. They're for lovemaking.
Marge Simpson: Really!?
Jacques: Yes... Champagne?
Marge Simpson: Please.
Jacques: There, my darling.
Marge Simpson: Thank you.
Jacques: What cosmic force brought us together, Marge?
Marge Simpson: Destiny?
Jacques: Yes... Some divine pin-spotter must have placed us side by side.
Marge Simpson: Like two fragile bowling pins...
Jacques: Standing bravely...
Marge Simpson: Until inevitably...
Jacques: We must topple.
Jacques: Marge, speak to me.
Marge Simpson: Is Thursday okay?
Jacques: It's okay indeed.
(Simpson Home: int. Simpson house - master bedroom - early evening)
Homer Simpson: For Marge?
Bart Simpson: (CHEERY) Hey, Dad. What do you say we toss the ol' apple around, huh? Sound like fun?
Homer Simpson: (EXHAUSTED) Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball.
Bart Simpson: Aw, come on, Dad. Get the lead out.
(YARD: ext. yard - early evening)
Bart Simpson: Simpson checks the runner on first. He's cool. He's fine. Here's the windup and... here's the pitch.
Bart Simpson: Dad, you didn't even say ouch.
Homer Simpson: Oh, sorry... ouch!
Bart Simpson: Lisa, Lisa! I think you're right about Dad. Something's very, very wrong here.
Lisa Simpson: Frightened, Bart? Welcome to Stage Three: Fear.
Bart Simpson: Well, come on. We gotta do something, man.
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, Bart. I'd love to help you but I'm mired in Stage Five, self-pity.
Bart Simpson: Look, Dad. I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some advice that might help.
Homer Simpson: I gave you advice? Get outta here.
Bart Simpson: Yeah. You did! You told me when something's bothering you, and you're too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut. At least that way you won't make things worse.
Homer Simpson: Hmm. Good advice.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - thursday morning)
Homer Simpson: (STRUGGLING FOR THE RIGHT WORDS) Marge, may I speak to you?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Homer Simpson: You know, I've been thinking... Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. But your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. I don't know how you do it. You've just got a gift, I guess. I've always thought so. I just never mentioned it. But it's time you knew how I feel. I don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. (BROKEN) ...Goodbye, my wife.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Homer.
(Jacques's Apartment: int. jacques' apartment)

Marge Simpson: So how was the office birthday party?
Homer Simpson: Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was (INDICATING WITH FINGERS) this thick. (CHUCKLES) And Eugene Fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. And he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance.
Marge Simpson: Does this girl like him?
Homer Simpson: Pffft. I have to warn you, Marge -- I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Just keepin' you on your toes, babe.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds?! (MOAN) I'm a blimp! Why are all the good things so tasty? From now on, exercise every morning.

Homer Simpson: Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance.
Marge Simpson: Homer, is this some kind of stag party?
Homer Simpson: No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing.
Marge Simpson: Eugene Fisk? Isn't he your assistant?
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) No, my supervisor.

Female Mail Carrier: (SIMULTANEOUS WITH ABOVE) Where's my spy camera? Every day for the last six months. Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera? Here's your stupid spy camera!

Martin Prince: Bart, I'd really appreciate a print of your masterwork.

C. Montgomery Burns: What in blue blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: What do you mean, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: I mean this!
C. Montgomery Burns: A plant employee carrying on like an oversexed orangutan in heat! This is a family nuclear-power plant, Simpson. Our research indicates that over 50 percent of our power is used by women. I will not have you offending my customers with your bawdy shenanigans!
Homer Simpson: It won't happen again, sir. I promise. May I get out of your sight now?
C. Montgomery Burns: Just a second, Simpson! Smithers, would you leave the room for a minute?
Waylon Smithers: Yes, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led a solitary life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, a certain... how shall I put it? Animal magnetisme. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret.
Homer Simpson: Uh... Mr. Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover-boy.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, I'm asking you nicely.

Homer Simpson: Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton. (BREAKING DOWN) Come on, Marge. Please forgive me? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Marge Simpson: Homer! You don't even know why you're apologizing.
Homer Simpson: Yes I do. Because I'm (PITIFULLY) hungry... my clothes are smelly... and I'm tired.
Marge Simpson: I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very bad lesson. Your boy idolizes you.
Homer Simpson: Oh, he does not!
Marge Simpson: Yes he does, Homer. And when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. You owe your son better than that, Homer.
Homer Simpson: So what should I do, Marge?
Marge Simpson: Well, I think you should take Bart to meet this exotic belly-person. I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her.
Homer Simpson: Okay. Your wish is my command, my little...

Homer Simpson: Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object.
Princess Kashmir: Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson: I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. I want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings, too.
Princess Kashmir: Oh, okay, but can we make it quick?
Bart Simpson: Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Homer Simpson: Could you tell him a little about yourself?

C. Montgomery Burns: You, with the hair. Down in front!
Marge Simpson: Oh, he's sunk even lower!
Homer Simpson: Quiet! I have something to say to all the sons out there; to all the boys; to all the men; to all of us. It's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. No, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews -- well, not our nephews -- they are our mothers. And you know something, folks? As ridiculous as it sounds, I would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as I sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string. Am I wrong, or am I right?

Adil Hoxha: (IN ALBANIAN) And I will miss you, but now I must go.
Seymour Skinner: Hello, Mrs. Simpson. I'm afraid there's been a very disturbing incident at school today.
Bart Simpson: I'm outta here, man.
Marge Simpson: Homer, Principal Skinner's here.
Homer Simpson: Oh, hello Principal Skinner. I'd get up but the boy crippled me.
Seymour Skinner: Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) That old gag.
Seymour Skinner: Unfortunately, at the same moment, my mother was in the girls' lavatory making use of the facilities.
Marge Simpson: Oh, dear.
Seymour Skinner: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible. I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick. I think it behooves us all to consider... deportation.
Marge Simpson: (AGHAST) Deportation! You mean kick Bart out of the country?
Homer Simpson: Hear him out, Marge.
Seymour Skinner: Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Now normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big exception. And, if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away.
Homer Simpson: Sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months.
Marge Simpson: Homer! You didn't even ask where Bart would be going.
Seymour Skinner: Actually, he'd be staying in France in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine country.
Marge Simpson: But Bart doesn't speak French.
Seymour Skinner: Oh! When he's totally immersed in a foreign language, the average child can become fluent in weeks.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, but what about Bart?
Seymour Skinner: I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And the whole thing won't cost you a dime as long you're willing to take in a student of your own.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam you are?
Seymour Skinner: Well, for one thing, you wouldn't be getting a French boy. You would be getting an Albanian.
Homer Simpson: You mean all white with pink eyes?
Seymour Skinner: No, no, no, no. A student from Albania. It's a country on the Adriatic Sea.
Marge Simpson: Well, going to France sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but I think Bart should have a say in this.
(Bart's Bedroom: int. bart's bedroom)
Bart Simpson: Aah, the life of a frog. That's the life for me.
Marge Simpson: Bart, how would you like to spend the next three months living in France?
Bart Simpson: France? Wow.
(LIVING ROOM: int. living room)
Homer Simpson: He makes me crazy twelve months a year. At least you get the summer off.
Seymour Skinner: Mmm-hmm.
Bart Simpson: And I'd get to take a plane there, wouldn't I, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Yes, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Wow. And one back?
Marge Simpson: Mmm-hmm. Well, Bart seems very enthusiastic about the idea.
Marge Simpson: Yes! Yes!
Seymour Skinner: Way to go!
Homer Simpson: Bon voyage, boy.

Bart Simpson: I know I'm going and you're not.
Homer Simpson: I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room.
Bart Simpson: Okay, Dad.

In this way, and only in this way, can we hope to better understand our backward neighbors throughout the world.
Adil Hoxha: Thank you, Principal Skinner. Thank you, fellow students. (BECOMING SLIGHTLY SINISTER) Although I have only been in your country a few days, I have already found Americans to be most... trusting.

Lisa Simpson: I'm defending a country where people can think and act and worship any way they want.
Adil Hoxha: Can not.
Lisa Simpson: Can, too.
Adil Hoxha: Can not.
Lisa Simpson: Can, too.
Homer Simpson: Please, please kids. Stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being a land of opportunity, and maybe Adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers.
Adil Hoxha: Your father is right. We should not fight. Friends?
Lisa Simpson: Well, okay.
Marge Simpson: Well, now that that's settled, I'll just clear the dishes.
Adil Hoxha: No, no, Mrs. Simpson. You have been oppressed enough for today. I will clear the dishes.
Marge Simpson: Oh. Okay.
Homer Simpson: Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Lisa Simpson: Your paper-thin commitment to your children sends shivers down my spine. May I be excused?
Marge Simpson: Lisa!
Homer Simpson: Oh, she's just jealous. She'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her. (LAUGHS)

UGOLIN: Now, go to sleep.
Bart Simpson: Hey! Hey! Come on. Move it, pal.
Cesar: You leave Maurice alone. The floor is good enough for you. You go to sleep there.

Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aww. You called me dad.
Adil Hoxha: Dad, do you think I could come visit you at the nuclear power plant?
Homer Simpson: You want to see where I work?
Adil Hoxha: Oh, yes, very much.
Homer Simpson: (SNIFFLES) None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.
Adil Hoxha: Then I can go?
Homer Simpson: Well, I'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in Security, but sure, you bet.
Adil Hoxha: (TENTING FINGERS) Excellent.
(VINEYARDS: ext. vineyards)
Cesar: Now watch me. (DEMONSTRATING) You grab the grape between your thumb and forefinger and gently twist it off and drop it in the bucket.
Cesar: Now you do it.

Homer Simpson: Sector Twelve?

Cesar: (IN FRENCH) Silence!
Marge Simpson: Everyone here in the United States is fine. We think Maggie may say her first word any day now. Lisa got an A in Math, which I'm only mentioning as news -- I'm not putting you down. And your father, well... last night he went to sleep talking about how much he loves you.

UGOLIN: Prison? Oh, my. (IN FRENCH: En prison? Oh, non!)
Lisa Simpson: Hi, Sideshow Bob.
Cesar: (CHUCKLING) Whenever I find my faith in a higher power shaken, I always think of the miracle of anti-freeze. Too much can be poison. (POURING SOME IN) But the right amount gives wine just the right kick. (IN FRENCH: Quand je sens que ma foi dans les forces supremes faiblit, je pense toujours au miracle de l'antigel. Si on en met trop, blen sur, c'est du poison. (POURING) Mais dans les proportions voulues, ca donne du corps au vin.)
UGOLIN: You put in too much. It may kill someone. (IN FRENCH: Je pense que tu en par trop. Tu vas tuer quelqu'un avec ca.)
Cesar: Kill someone? Don't be ridiculous. (IN FRENCH: Tuer quelqu'un? T'es fou!)
Cesar: What are you doing? Get out of here.

Cesar: On second thought, Bart, Bart, come here. (TO UGOLIN) Watch, I bet it won't even blind him. (IN FRENCH: Regarde. Je te parie que ca va meme pas le rendre aveugie.)
Cesar: Drink this.
Bart Simpson: Uh, no thanks.
Cesar: Do not worry. This is France. It is customary for children to take a little wine now and then.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, but it's got anti-freeze in there.
Cesar: Drink it!
Bart Simpson: (BURPS)
Cesar: (TO UGOLIN) He sees well enough. Now, go buy a case of anti-freeze. (IN FRENCH: Qu'est ce que je t'avais dit? Maintenant, va nous chercher une caisse d'antigel au magasin.)
UGOLIN: But it is raining outside. Let's make the wine tomorrow. (IN FRENCH: Mais il pleut. Est qu'on peut attendre et faire le vin demair?)

These two guys I'm staying with work me night and day, they don't feed me, they make me sleep on the floor, they put anti-freeze in the wine, and they gave my red hat to the donkey.)

Cia Agent #1: Mmm-hmm. Through the use of radio triangulation, we tracked him to exactly this point.
Homer Simpson: Wow!
Cia Agent #1: That's all I can tell you.
Homer Simpson: Aw!

Marge Simpson: Homer, I'd love a glass of that wine Bart brought us.

Krusty the Clown: Or do you want me to shoot Sideshow Bob out of a cannon? (LAUGHS)
Sideshow Bob: (BLOWS HIS WHISTLE DOWN)
Lisa Simpson: (CHANTING) The cannon. The cannon. The cannon. The cannon.
Brittany: The cannon.
Krusty the Clown: (SHRUGS) Sorry Sideshow Bob, but it's her special birthday wish.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHING) You're doomed, Sideshow Bob.
Krusty the Clown: I know we haven't had much luck shooting you out of this cannon, but maybe that's because we haven't used enough gun powder!
Krusty the Clown: Brittany, do the honors.
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGH) Don't blame me --
Lisa Simpson: I didn't do it!

Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... (GASPS) New flavor! Triple chocolate!
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: What's the matter, sir? Never have I seen you look so unhappy while purchasing such a large quantity of ice cream.
Homer Simpson: The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, "the gruesome twosome." (CHUCKLES)
Krusty the Clown: Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy....
Homer Simpson: (TURNING AROUND) Sorry, pal...

Scott Christian: The news story behind that enigmatic half-joke right after this commercial message.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. Bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?
Bart Simpson: Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?

Scott Christian: And just in... actual footage of the crime taken with the Kwik-E-Mart security camera.

Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer.
Patty Bouvier: So, the truth comes out.
Krusty the Clown: Hand over all your money in a paper bag.
Bart Simpson: Oh... oh! Krusty, how could you?
Marge Simpson: I know it looks very bad, honey -- but who knows? Maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along.

Krusty the Clown: Buy my cereal. (LAUGHS)
Krusty the Clown: I didn't do it.
Bart Simpson: I wish I could believe you.
Kent Brockman: Good evening again, Springfield. Krusty the Clown, the beloved idol of countless tots, now nothing more than a common alleged criminal. His trial, which begins tomorrow, has taken center ring in a national media circus as children of all ages, from eight to eighty, hang on each new development like so many Rumanian trapeze artists.
Kent Brockman: From his humble beginnings as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi...
Kent Brockman: Krusty clowned his way to the top of a personal mini-empire --
Kent Brockman: -- with dozens of endorsements, including his own line of pork products. This may have led to one of television's best-loved bloopers -- Krusty's near fatal on-the-air heart attack in 1986.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, son. You'll understand one day.
(Moe's Tavern: INT. MOE'S TAVERN)
Krusty the Clown: Wasn't that a great Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, kids? Well, we've got another one coming right up, but first I got a hankerin' for some pork products.
Krusty the Clown: Mmmm. Look! Plump succulent sausage, honey-smoked bacon and glistening, sizzling...(GASPING SOUND)
Krusty the Clown: I'm dying! I'm dying!
Kent Brockman: But a quick triple bypass and a pacemaker later, Krusty bounced back. However, he was a changed clown. Where his show had been condemned by parents and educators alike as simple-minded TV mayhem...
Kent Brockman: This new Krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping out illiteracy in today's anything-for-a- thrill youth.
Krusty the Clown: Give a hoot! Read a book!
Kent Brockman: Krusty's arrest has sent shock waves through Springfield, packing its churches, synagogues and mosques with disillusioned citizenry from all walks of life.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I urge every halfway decent member of our community to gather up all merchandise that bears the likeness of Krusty, that clown prince of corruption, and join me in a public burning.
Kent Brockman: So is Krusty the Clown about to trade in his baggy pants for the relatively snug uniform of Springfield Penitentiary? We'll find out tomorrow when his trial begins.

Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS) Uh... I mean, not guilty. Opening night jitters, your honor.
District Attorney: I would like to call to the stand, Homer J. Simpson.
Bart Simpson: Don't do it, Dad. Please don't do it.
Bart Simpson: He's innocent, I tell you. Krusty would never do something like that. Ah come on Dad, you gotta listen to me.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
District Attorney: Mr. Simpson, was that you taking that cowardly dive into that display of heavily-salted snack treats?
Homer Simpson: Yes, sir.
District Attorney: Hmmm hmmm. Do you recognize the gunman in this courtroom today?
Homer Simpson: Yes, I do.
District Attorney: Fine, would you point him out to us?
Homer Simpson: Okay.

(Courtroom: int. courtroom)
District Attorney: Krusty, would you please turn your attention to Exhibit B, and tell me what you see?

Krusty the Clown: (PITIFULLY) Uh... uh...
District Attorney: What's the matter, can't you read?
Krusty the Clown: (BREAKING DOWN INTO TEARS) No, I can't! I can't read or write! I admit it! I'm totally illiterate! Now are you happy?
Judge Snyder: (TO KRUSTY) Can it be that the champion of child literacy can't even read himself?
Krusty the Clown: Is it a crime to be illiterate?
Bart Simpson: So?
Bart Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, Al. Last name, Koholic.
District Attorney: All right, all right. See this, Krusty? This is a 'B'. And this is Exhibit B. Betting slips, obtained by this court indicating you have lost substantial sums of money on sports gambling --
Krusty the Clown: Is it a crime to bet on sporting events?
District Attorney: Yes, it is.
Krusty the Clown: Oh.
Judge Snyder: Foreperson, have you reached a verdict?
Foreperson: Yes, we have, your honor. We find the defendant, Krusty the Clown... guilty.

Sideshow Bob: My young friends. For years I have been silent, save for the crude glissandos of this primitive wind instrument. But now destiny has thrust me into the center ring. In the coming weeks, you will notice some rather sweeping changes in our program. Please, do not be alarmed. Itchy and Scratchy will still have a home here, but we will also learn about nutrition, self-esteem, etiquette and all the lively arts.
Bart Simpson: What the hell are you doing, Lis?
Lisa Simpson: I'm watching Sideshow Bob. You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Krusty used to be.
Bart Simpson: You backstabber, you traitor, you...
Lisa Simpson: (SLAPS BART IN THE FACE) Snap out of it, Bart. Face the facts. All those hours we spent staring at Krusty, we were staring at a crook.
Bart Simpson: Look, Lisa, I know Krusty's innocent. Don't ask me why. It's just a feeling I have.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Come on, Lisa. I think I can prove Krusty's innocent, but I need your help.
Lisa Simpson: You do? Why?
Bart Simpson: Oh, come on Lis, you know why.
Lisa Simpson: No, why?
Bart Simpson: (RELUCTANTLY) I'll never forgive you for making me say this, but... you're smarter than me.

Lisa Simpson: Don't you remember the get-well card we sent to Krusty? It was after his heart attack, when he had a pacemaker put in.
Bart Simpson: Ah ha!
Lisa Simpson: Wait a minute. Krusty can't read.
Bart Simpson: (CRACKING) Okay! okay! So the poor guy can't read! Can't we get off his back already?
Lisa Simpson: No! Don't you get it, Bart? How could Krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Hey, hey. This is not a lending library. If you're not going to buy that thing, put it down or I'll blow your heads off.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I'm starting to think you're right. Krusty was framed. Did he have any enemies?
Bart Simpson: I don't know, but I know someone who would: Krusty's best friend in the whole world, Sideshow Bob.

Sideshow Bob: (CHUCKLING) Certainly. I take great pride in being able to sign my own name.
Bart Simpson: Sideshow Bob, can we ask you a few--
Sideshow Bob: Forgive me, children. As much as Sideshow Bob would love to chat, he has a show starting in moments. Here you go. Three tickets, be my guest.
Bart Simpson: (RELUCTANTLY) Well, okay, but...
Sideshow Bob: Come, come, let's run along.
(TV Studio: int. television studio - sideshow bob show)
Sideshow Bob: Hello, children. Whom do you love?
Lisa Simpson: Sideshow Bob!
Lisa Simpson: Come on, Bart. Go with the flow.
Sideshow Bob: How much do you love me?
Lisa Simpson: With all our hearts!
Bart Simpson: About a zillionth as much as I love Krusty.
Sideshow Bob: Today's show promises to be a marvelous celebration of the human spirit. But first, I regret to say I see a youngster who looks troubled.
Sideshow Bob: What's your name, young man?
Bart Simpson: Bart Simpson, sir.
Sideshow Bob: Mmm... Well, perhaps we can shed some light on your problem in a new segment exploring pre-adolescent turmoil. I call it "Choices."
Bart Simpson: I don't think so, sir.
Sideshow Bob: Bart, I'm reaching out to you.
Sideshow Bob: So what's on your mind, Bart? I bet the other children don't accept you.
Bart Simpson: True, Sideshow Bob, but that doesn't bother me. You see, my sisters and I have been doing a little investigating, and it looks to us like Krusty was framed.
Sideshow Bob: (NERVOUS) Framed?
Bart Simpson: Well, the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the Kwik-E-Mart. But Krusty couldn't go near the thing. Not with his pacemaker.
Sideshow Bob: Well, you know Bart, as much as I love Krusty, he was never one to take doctors' orders too seriously.
Bart Simpson: Well, maybe. But, get this, Krusty was illiterate and the guy who robbed the store was reading the Springfield Review of Books.
Sideshow Bob: Ah, well, Bart...
Sideshow Bob: The fact is, you don't have to be able to read to enjoy the Springfield
Sideshow Bob: Review of Books. Just look at these amusing caricatures of Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, I guess those are kinda funny.
Sideshow Bob: Bart, (TO AUDIENCE) children, this whole sordid affair has been a shock to all of us, but we must get on with our lives. Let's try to remember Krusty not as a hardened criminal, but as that lovable jester who honked his horn and puttered around in his little car.
Bart Simpson: (GOING ALONG) And shot you out of a cannon.
Sideshow Bob: (BITTERLY) And shot me out of a cannon. Yes, we will never forget that will we? (THEN) Bart, open your heart. I admit I have some mighty big shoes to fill, but if you give me a chance, I promise you won't be disap...
Sideshow Bob: (ECHOING) Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill.
Sideshow Bob: You know, in ancient Greece, there was a school of thought called stoicist...
Bart Simpson: (OUTRAGED) Wait a minute! You did it!
Sideshow Bob: Excuse me?
Bart Simpson: Attention, fellow children. Krusty didn't rob that store. Sideshow Bob framed him and I got proof.
Sideshow Bob: Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy...
Bart Simpson: See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes but he's got little feet, like all good-hearted people.
Bart Simpson: Sideshow Bob really fills his shoe with big ugly feet.
Lou: The kid's right.
Eddie: How do you figure we missed that?
Chief Wiggum: Get off your duffs, boys. Get down to that studio!
(TELEVISION STATION: ext. television station)
Sideshow Bob: Yes, I admit it. I hated him. His hackneyed shenanigans robbed me of my dignity for years. I played the buffoon while he squandered a fortune on his vulgar appetites. That's why I framed Krusty. I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for these meddling kids.
Bart Simpson: Take him away, boys.
Sideshow Bob: Treat kids as equals. They're people too. They're smarter than you think. They were smart enough to catch me.
(Jailhouse: ext. jailhouse - day)
Chief Wiggum: Well, we made a terrible, terrible mistake. Uh... won't happen again.
Krusty the Clown: It better not, you dimwit.
Homer Simpson: Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court. I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (THRU RADIO) Okay... let's see... next we have...
Krusty the Clown: Well, the important thing is that I regained the trust of the children, but there was one boy who trusted me all along. Bart?
Bart Simpson: Yes, sir.
Krusty the Clown: Thank you.

(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT)
Homer Simpson: Hey, turn it up. I love hearing those whack-os.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) Tell me about your husband, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Well. (INTO PHONE) When we were dating he was sweeter, and more romantic, and forty pounds thinner, and he had hair, and he ate with utensils.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) What was that last thing you said?
Worker One: Hey, isn't that your wife, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Don't be ridiculous. My wife worships the ground I walk on.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) Marge, I-it's what I call harsh reality time.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE; WORRIED) Ohhh.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) Your husband sees you as nothing.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh. Okay, well thank you.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) No, no, don't hang up! The pig has made you into his mother. You are not the hot love object you deserve to be.
Marge Simpson: Really?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: I'm as sure of it as I'm sure my voice is annoying. Marge, tonight, the second he comes through that front door, you've got to tell him you're fed up. And if he doesn't start loving, you'll be leaving.
Marge Simpson: Leave Homer?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Please. Don't use his real name.
Marge Simpson: Leave Pedro?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (FROM RADIO) Can you be that honest, Marge?

Dr. Marvin Monroe: (FROM RADIO) You'll tell him right when he comes home from work?

Homer Simpson: Let's just say, I don't feel like goin' home tonight. Jar, please.
Moe Szyslak: Hey, you can level with me. You got a domestic situation?
Homer Simpson: (CONTEMPLATES HIS EGG, THEN JAMS IT IN MOUTH) You might say that. My wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks I'm a pig.
Moe Szyslak: Homer?
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) What?
Moe Szyslak: Marge is right. You are a pig. You can ask anyone in this bar.
Homer Simpson: What? (YELLS) Hey, Barney, am I a pig?
Barney Gumble: (DRUNKENLY) You're no more of a pig than I am. (BURP)
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh, no.
Moe Szyslak: See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards.
Homer Simpson: Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that.
Moe Szyslak: I'm not done. (LEANS IN) After dinner, the two of you are going to check into the fanciest motel in town, and not check out until the next morning. If you get my drift.

Homer Simpson: Why?
Maitre D': Well, when you choose one that's floating upside down, it somewhat defeats the purpose of selecting a live lobster.

Bart Simpson: This way to the scene of the crime, men. I've got her tied up in the den.
Homer Simpson: Just a minute, young man. I don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but I just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off so that --
Tv Reporter: Excuse me, sir, are you saying to the world that you just aided and abetted the escape of the notorious Babysitter Bandit?
Homer Simpson: The what?

Homer Simpson: (PAUSE) Uh... uh... no. Are you sure this microphone works? (TAPS THE MIKE) Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her. (TAPS AGAIN) This is on, right? Because, actually, it was quite a struggle.

Homer Simpson: (ON TV) Have you ever seen a Kung Fu movie? (GESTURES) It was just like that. But now I know her moves. (TO CAMERA) So, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on Homer Simpson again.
Homer Simpson: (DEFEATED) Lord help me, I'm just not that bright.

Bart Simpson: (LOOKING AT BOOK) It's about these pirates. Pirates with patches over their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... and green birds on their shoulders...
Bart Simpson: Did I mention this book was written by a guy named Robert Louis Stevenson? And published by the good people at McGraw Hill.
Bart Simpson: So in conclusion, on the Simpsons' scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, one being the lowest, and five being average, I give this book... a nine.
Bart Simpson: (CLEARING THROAT) Any questions?
Bart Simpson: No? Then I'll just sit down.

Bart Simpson: (COYLY) Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Homer Simpson: Hey, Dr. J.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: I think what we have on our hands here is a classic case of what laymen refer to as fear of failure. As a result, Bart is an underachiever. And yet he seems to be... how should I put this...? Proud of it?
Homer Simpson: (NODDING) Hmmm...
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: One of his problems may be his short attention span, which can lead to...

Bart Simpson: (WILD EYED) Okay... okay! Why are we dancing around the obvious? I know it. You know it. I am dumb. Okay? Dumb as a post. Do you think I'm happy about it?
Marge Simpson: There, there, Bart. You're just a late bloomer.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Oh... I wish it were that simple. As shameful and as emotionally crippling as it may be, I'm afraid my recommendation is for Bart Simpson (BEAT) to repeat the fourth grade.
Bart Simpson: What! You can't hold me back. I'll do better, I promise.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe it would help him to be left back. It won't be so bad, Bart.
Bart Simpson: No, I mean it. You can't hold me back. I swear I'm gonna do better. Look at my eyes. See the sincerity, see the conviction, see the fear. As God is my witness, I can pass the fourth grade.
Homer Simpson: And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids.
(School Bus: INT. SCHOOL BUS - MORNING)
Otto Mann: Get off the bus or forever hold your peace, little dudes.

Otto Mann: So what's in your head, little man?
Bart Simpson: (WRINGING HANDS) Well, I've been failing a lot of tests recently.
Otto Mann: (VERY DIM) Yuh huh.
Bart Simpson: And now they're talking about holding me back in the fourth grade if I don't shape up.
Otto Mann: (NODDING) That's it? Hey, relax man. It could end up being the best thing that ever happened to you. I got held back in the fourth grade myself -- twice. And look at me, man. (WITH PRIDE) Now I drive the school bus.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: I'm afraid my recommendation is for Bart Simpson to repeat the fourth grade. (ECHOEY) Repeat the fourth grade. Repeat the fourth grade. Repeat the fourth grade.

Martin Prince: Well, back to the forecastle of the Pequod.
Bart Simpson: Hm, hey, Martin.
Homer Simpson: I have hair! Look! Look!
Martin Prince: (BACKING AWAY) You have your ball back. I have nothing else of value.
Bart Simpson: I need you to help me get a passing grade.
Martin Prince: Well, you do need someone's help to get a passing grade but I don't know why that someone should be me.
Bart Simpson: Because I can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you so much.
Martin Prince: (TAKEN ABACK) They... laugh at me? I'd always considered myself rather popular.
Bart Simpson: You're not. Watch!
Martin Prince: Then my-my speed with numbers... my years of service as a hall monitor... my prize winning diaramas... these things mean nothing to them?
Bart Simpson: Perhaps another demonstration.

Executive #3: I think you mean him, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: You then! How would you improve the worker situation?
Homer Simpson: Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks.
C. Montgomery Burns: Fish sticks? What in blazes are you talking about?
Homer Simpson: Well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them.
C. Montgomery Burns: I know what fish sticks are! Get to the point!
Homer Simpson: Well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and I always run out.
Waylon Smithers: Will you stop wasting our time, Simpson?
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up, Smithers. Can't you see what he's saying? A happy worker is a busy worker. Three cents worth of tartar sauce could save us thousands of man-hours in labor. I like the cut of your jib, Simpson. (PAUSES, TENTING HIS FINGERS) Let the fools have their tar-tar sauce!
Homer Simpson: Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmmm. Brilliant. Who could have ever imagined that Simpson's sweeping reforms would pay off so quickly?
Waylon Smithers: You know, sir, accidents decreased by exactly the number that Simpson himself is known or suspected to have caused last month. And our output level was just as high during Simpson's last vacation.
C. Montgomery Burns: My dear tired old Smithers, do I detect a note of jealousy?
C. Montgomery Burns: It is time. Give Simpson the key.
Karl: Mr. Simpson, don't sit on that filthy thing one second longer! They've given you the key!
Homer Simpson: (GASP) The key!
Karl: Stunning. Absolutely stunning.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, hey ho, men. You know I was watching the DuMont last night and I happened to catch a fascinating documentary on Rommel, the Desert Fox. Now there's a man who could get things done.
C. Montgomery Burns: Towel please, Simpson.
Waylon Smithers: Allow me, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: I said, Simpson!
Waylon Smithers: But...
Homer Simpson: Sure thing, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well done, Simpson. Now, walk behind me down the hallway.
Homer Simpson: Can do, sir.
Waylon Smithers: (READING FORM) A thousand dollars, Dimoxinil, "Keep brain from freezing." Now I've got you, Simpson.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BACKYARD - AFTERNOON)
Marge Simpson: Homer, between your hair care products and new wardrobe, we're not saving anything for a rainy day?
Homer Simpson: Rainy day. There's never gonna be a be a rainy day, Marge. There's not a cloud in the Simpson sky. And what does my little girl want?
Lisa Simpson: An absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
Homer Simpson: Yea... eh... how about a pony?
Lisa Simpson: Okay.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - DAY)
C. Montgomery Burns: I want you to weave that patented Simpson magic with my executives. A short speech, work work work, you know.
Homer Simpson: Uh, well okay, what the hey?
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. Set you to your task, Simpson.
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns, it is my sad duty to report that one of your executives has bilked the company insurance plan out of a thousand dollars.
C. Montgomery Burns: What! Blast his hide to Hades! (BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED) And I was going to buy that ivory back scratcher! How did he do it?
Waylon Smithers: He charged the company for dimoxinil. It's a baldness cure.
C. Montgomery Burns: Thank you very much, Professor Science! I know what dimoxinil is. Now go and make an example of this hooligan.
Waylon Smithers: With pleasure, sir.
Homer Simpson: Karl, you gotta help me. Mr. Burns wants me to make some speech to his executives and -- what do you want?
Waylon Smithers: Oh, just thought I'd drop by to tell you that... you're fired.
Homer Simpson: What?
Waylon Smithers: Our company does not look kindly upon one thousand dollars worth of insurance fraud. Clean out your desk by noon, Simpson.
Karl: Wait! (PAUSE) Mr. Smithers, Homer Simpson is innocent. I did this.
Homer Simpson: You did?
Waylon Smithers: What are you talking about?
Karl: Mr. Simpson was unaware of any impropriety. I take full responsibility.
Waylon Smithers: (DISAPPOINTED) Really. Oh, well then, you're fired... whoever you are.
Karl: (WRITING CHECK) Here's your thousand dollars.
Waylon Smithers: (TO KARL) Hey, what do you care if this guy's bald?
Karl: My reasons (PAUSE) are my own.
Homer Simpson: Karl, you saved me. Why?
Karl: Have I done something extraordinary here today? No. I did what I was born to do, what any good soldier would have done when a live grenade threatened his commander. I threw myself upon it and bore its terrible brunt.
Homer Simpson: Well, thanks, Karl. I don't know what to say.
Karl: Just walk me to my car.
Homer Simpson: Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you.
Karl: Bye, Mr. Simpson.
Karl: Oh, Mr. Simpson, did you bring an umbrella today?

Homer Simpson: Bart, what are you doing?
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Why you little...
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Ahhhh!
Homer Simpson: Boy must die.
Bart Simpson: (CHOKED UP) I love you, Dad.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. You ruined your father. You've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary.
Marge Simpson: Homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --
Homer Simpson: I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don't you, Marge? You do... you do. You've been squirreling it away, haven't you? Saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? Right? Right?
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Lisa Simpson: (TO BART) Dad is taking this in a less than heroic fashion.
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING)
Marge Simpson: Oh Homie, I'm so sorry.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - HOMER'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING)
Waylon Smithers: You've got that big speech in five minutes, Simpson. Huh, you're not gonna hang yourself, are you? (CHUCKLE)
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Karl: Dear Mr. Simpson: I have taken the liberty of preparing your speech on the enclosed numbered three-by five cards. All the big words are spelled (SLOWLY) phon-et-ic-al-ly. God bless you. You are one of Springfield's very special creatures. Your obedient servant, Karl. Good luck, sir.
Homer Simpson: Karl! So that wasn't just a sweet voice I heard inside my head. What are you doing here?
Karl: I just came to say goodbye to the gals in the typing pool.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, well, thanks for the speech, Karl, but I can't give it. (DISTRAUGHT) Look at me!
Karl: I guess I haven't taught you anything.
Homer Simpson: What do you mean?
Karl: Don't you see? The tartar sauce, the bathroom key -- drying your boss's hands. You did it all! It was never the hair. You did it, because you believed you could, and you still can.
Homer Simpson: No, I can't. I'm just a big fool.
Karl: Oh no, you're not.
Homer Simpson: How do you know?
Karl: Because my mother taught me never to kiss a fool.
Homer Simpson: Karl.
Karl: Now go get 'em, tiger.
Homer Simpson: (GROWL)
C. Montgomery Burns: And now, with some fresh insights, one of the rising young stars of our nuclear family, Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: What in blazes? Who is that old geezer? And what has he done with Homer Simpson?
Waylon Smithers: (CHUCKLING) He is Homer Simpson, sir.
Homer Simpson: A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.
C. Montgomery Burns: He's crazy!
Homer Simpson: Yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. Bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- I can save this company millions of dollars a year. How? Through Jiko Kanri, the Japanese art of self-management. You see, in the West... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of...
Homer Simpson: (STRUGGLING) Five thousand two... I mean... (GIVING UP) Lots of money.
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns' office. Right now.
Waylon Smithers: Dead man comin' through.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, well, well! Our dashing young junior executive! You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to.
Homer Simpson: Uh, why?
C. Montgomery Burns: (BEAT) Simpson, how old do you think I am?
Homer Simpson: I don't know... a hundred and two?
C. Montgomery Burns: I am only eighty-one. You may find this hard to believe... but in my salad days, my crowning glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ooh, I was big man on campus until my senior year, when I became as bald as a plucked chicken. You see, Simpson, I too know the sting of male-pattern baldness. That's why I'm giving you your old job back.
Homer Simpson: What! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now get out of here before I reconsider.
Homer Simpson: Oh, better hurry up.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING)
Marge Simpson: Homer, are you still awake?
Homer Simpson: I've never been more awake in my life.
Marge Simpson: What's wrong?
Homer Simpson: Are you kidding? I'm stuck in that dead-end job again. The kids are gonna hate me cause I can't buy them all that stuff I promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause I'm ugly and bald.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer. Your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it.
Homer Simpson: And... and?! (BARELY ABLE TO ASK) What about loving me?
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer, honey. Come here.
Homer Simpson: What?!
Marge Simpson: Come here. (GRABS HIS FACE) (SINGING PASSIONATELY) "YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / (CONTINUES SINGING) CAN'T YOU SEE? / YOU'RE EVERYTHING THAT I HOPED FOR /

Homer Simpson: HOMER MARGE
Homer Simpson: to me."
Marge Simpson: (CLEARING HER THROAT) Hello, everyone. (CLEARING HER THROAT) You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... things on T.V. that are completely inappropriate for younger viewers. Things like the following half hour. Nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, which I totally wash my hands of, is really scary, so if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight, instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. Thanks for your attention.
(House: ext. house - night)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Oooo! What a haul this year. I love Halloween.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. Let's see what the kids are up to.
Lisa Simpson: ... and the policeman on the other end of the phone said, "We have traced the call. It's coming from the floor below you. Get out of the house!" But it was too late. End of story.
Bart Simpson: Yawn. I heard that when I was in the third grade. It's not scary.
Lisa Simpson: Is too.
Bart Simpson: Is not.
Lisa Simpson: Is too.
Bart Simpson: Is not.
Lisa Simpson: Is too.
Bart Simpson: Is not.
Lisa Simpson: Fine. Then you tell one scarier.
Bart Simpson: Flashlight, please.
Bart Simpson: Here's a story that's really scarifying.

Moving Man: A buck! I'm glad there's a curse on this place.
Homer Simpson: Huh? (TO FAMILY - SURVEYING THE ROOM) Well... it's all ours!
Marge Simpson: I still can't believe how inexpensive it was.
Homer Simpson: Motivated seller, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Well, he certainly must have been motivated. Prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able to afford this.
Homer Simpson: So we got a good deal for once. Quit fighting it.
Marge Simpson: It just seems too good to be true.
Lisa Simpson: Ow! Mom! Bart threw a book at me.
Bart Simpson: Did not.
Lisa Simpson: Did too.
Bart Simpson: Did not.

Homer Simpson: Okay boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one.
Lisa Simpson: (QUIETLY) I can feel an evil presence in this house.
Marge Simpson: Evil!
Homer Simpson: Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your mother.
Marge Simpson: Children, get your coats. We're leaving this house right now.
Homer Simpson: Now wait a minute, Marge. It's only natural there would be some things wrong with an old house like this. It's a fixer-upper. What's the problem? we get a bunch of priests in here...
Marge Simpson: I'm not going to live in a house of evil just to save a few dollars.
Homer Simpson: (GENUINELY OUTRAGED) Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars! We're talking about a few thousand dollars!
Homer Simpson: It's got great high ceilings.

Kang: I beg your pardon.

Kang: You mean this? (HOLDS UP BOOK) It's a harmless cookbook. It's just a little dusty.
Lisa Simpson: Wait a minute!
Kang: Wait, there's still more space dust on here.
Kang: (UTTER DISBELIEF) Let me get this straight. You thought...
Kodos: (ANGRY) They thought we were going to eat them.
Kang: (APPALLED) Good God! Is this some kind of joke?
Kodos: No, they're serious...
Lisa Simpson: Well, why were you trying to make us eat all the time?
Kang: Make you eat? We merely provided a sumptuous banquet and, frankly, you people made pigs of yourselves.
Serak The Preparer: I slaved in the kitchen for days for you people and...
Kang: (SARCASTIC) Well, if you wanted to make Serak the Preparer cry, mission accomplished.

(CHAMBER: int. chamber - night)
Lisa Simpson: Once upon a midnight dreary,
Lisa Simpson: while I pondered, weak and weary,
V.O.: Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Marge Simpson: Like what?
V.O.: As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
Homer Simpson: (DISMISSING) 'Tis some visitor,
V.O.: I muttered,
Homer Simpson: -- tapping at my chamber door -- Only this and nothing more.
Bart Simpson: Are we scared yet?
Lisa Simpson: Bart, he's establishing mood.
V.O.: Ah, distinctly I remember. It was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; -- vainly I had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow:
V.O.: -- sorrow for the lost Lenore --
Homer Simpson: Oh, Lenore.
V.O.: For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -- Nameless here for evermore.
Homer Simpson: Aag!
V.O.: And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating;
Homer Simpson: (TERRIFIED, CHANTING RAPIDLY) 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- This it is and nothing more.
V.O.: Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer;
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY AND OBSEQUIOUSLY) Sir --
V.O.: -- said I --
Homer Simpson: -- or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you.
V.O.: Here I opened wide the door; --
Bart Simpson: This better be good.
V.O.: Darkness there and nothing more.
Bart Simpson: You know what would have been scarier than nothing?
Lisa Simpson: What?
Bart Simpson: Anything!
V.O.: Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Surely --
V.O.: -- said I --
Homer Simpson: -- surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --
Chief Inspector: Mr. Burns in twenty years I have never seen such a shoddy, deplorable --
(Simpson Dining Room: int. simpsons' dining room - next evening)
V.O.: Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he, But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -- Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -- Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES, THEN FRIENDLY) Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --
V.O.: I said --
Homer Simpson: -- art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- Tell me... tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Bart Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Eat my shorts!
Lisa Simpson: Bart! Stop it. He says "nevermore". That's all he'll ever say.
Bart Simpson: Okay, okay.
V.O.: Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by some unseen censer,
Homer Simpson: Ouch! Censer..
V.O.: Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
Homer Simpson: (PLEADING) Wretch --
V.O.: I cried --
Homer Simpson: -- thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. (GETTING TEARY) Respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Raven: Nevermore.
Homer Simpson: (ANOTHER ANNOYED GRUNT, THEN) Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!
V.O.: I shrieked of starting,
Homer Simpson: Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Oh, leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Raven: Nevermore.
Homer Simpson: Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Raven: Nevermore.
Homer Simpson: Why you little --!
Raven: Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Come back here now, Raven
Bart Simpson: Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore.
(GARAGE: INT. GARAGE - DAY)
V.O.: And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting, On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, Shall be lifted -- nevermore!
(Bart's Treehouse: INT. TREE HOUSE)
Bart Simpson: Lisa, that wasn't scary. Not even for a poem.
Lisa Simpson: Well, it was written in 1845. Maybe people were easier to scare back then.
Bart Simpson: Well yeah, like when you look at "Friday The 13th, Part I," it's pretty tame by today's standards.
Marge Simpson: Children, bedtime.
Bart Simpson: I guess I'll have no trouble gettin' to sleep tonight.

Homer Simpson: Oh... oh, I hate Halloween.
(SUNNY SKY: ext. sunny sky - day)
Dave Shutton: (INTERESTED NOISE) So kids, caught anything?
Lisa Simpson: Not yet, sir.
Dave Shutton: Uh-huh. Ah, What are you using for bait?
Lisa Simpson: My brother's using worms but I who feel that tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing.
Dave Shutton: I see. And uh, what's your name, son?
Bart Simpson: I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Dave Shutton: (CHUCKLE) I'm Dave Shutton. I'm an investigative reporter who's on the road a lot, and uh, I must say that in my day we didn't talk that way to our elders.
Bart Simpson: Well, this is my day and we do, sir.
Bart Simpson: All right! We eat tonight!
Dave Shutton: Wait a minute. (STARTS COUNTING) One, two, three.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - morning)
Marge Simpson: Well leave it to good old Mary Bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.
Homer Simpson: (SNORTS) Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time.
Homer Simpson: Like getting Washington's birthday and Lincoln's birthday back as separate paid holidays. (DERISIVELY) President's Day! Pfft. What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out --
Marge Simpson: You're late for work, Homer.
Homer Simpson: So... Someone will punch in for me.
Lisa Simpson: Try not to spill anything, Dad.
Bart Simpson: Keep those mutants comin', Homer.
Homer Simpson: I'll mutant you.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - day)
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh, man. Plain cake donuts? Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. (MUMBLING TO HIMSELF) Why can't I ever get here on time?
C. Montgomery Burns: (OVER P.A.- FRIENDLY) Hi, ho, faceless employees. In a few moments the government inspection team will be touring your plant so look busy and keep your mouths shut. That is all.
(SECURITY CLEARANCE BOOTH AT POWER PLANT: ext. security clearance booth at power plant)
Waylon Smithers: Very stirring, sir.
Waylon Smithers: Uh oh. Here they come.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hold me, Smithers.
Chief Inspector: (TO TEAM) Okay men, Geiger counters on.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES WEAKLY) I suppose that's normal background radiation? The kind you would find in any well-maintained nuclear facility? Or, for that matter, playgrounds and hospitals.
Chief Inspector: Sorry.
(COOLING TOWER: EXT. COOLING TOWER - DAY)
Chief Inspector: (WHISTLES) Gum used to seal crack in cooling tower.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm as shocked as you are.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - work station)
Chief Inspector: Plutonium rod used as paperweight.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Now, that shouldn't be.
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISMISSING) Yeah. Well that's always been like that.
Homer Simpson: (WAKENS WITH A SHRIEK) Uh, uh, just resting my eyes.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, well done. A rested employee is a vigilant employee.
Chief Inspector: Monitoring station unmanned.
(Other Part of Nuclear Plant: int. another part of power plant)
C. Montgomery Burns: Look here, Inspector. Could I speak to you privately I-in my office?
(Burns's Office: INT. BURNS' OFFICE)
(Burns's Living Room: int. burns' living room - that night)
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, look! Some careless person has left thousands and thousands of dollars just lying here on my coffee table. Uh, Smithers, why don't we leave the room and hopefully, when we return the pile of money will be gone.
C. Montgomery Burns: (THROUGH HIS TEETH) Look Smithers, the money and a very stupid man are still here.
Chief Inspector: Burns, if I didn't know better I'd think you were trying to bribe me.
C. Montgomery Burns: Is there some confusion about this?
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRILY) Take it! Take it, take it, you poor schmoe.
Chief Inspector: Mr. Burns, I am going to overlook this felony. However, I will not overlook the three hundred and forty-two violations I have observed at your plant today. Either bring this place up to code or we'll shut it down. Good-day.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, well... a little dab of paint here, a little spackle there... how much could it possibly cost to fix this place up?
Waylon Smithers: Hmmm, approximately fifty-six million dollars, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRILY) Fifty-six million!
Waylon Smithers: (FRIGHTENED) Don't hit me, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (DEFEATED) Oh, that I had the strength to take it out on you, Smithers. Now please go. I would be alone.
C. Montgomery Burns: (MELANCHOLY SINGING) ONCE I BUILT A RAILROAD / MADE IT RUN / MADE IT RACE AGAINST TIME/ ONCE I BUILT A RAILROAD / NOW IT'S DONE / BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE A DIME./ HALF A MILLION BOOTS WENT SLOGGING THROUGH HELL / I WAS THE KID WITH THE DRUM.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - outside secondary monitoring station)
C. Montgomery Burns: Empty! Bah!!
Homer Simpson: Ah! (WAKING) Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. (LOOKS AT HIS WATCH) Holy moly! Nine-thirty.
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Marge. Sorry I didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... Yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me.
Homer Simpson: Echo, echo... (ECHO CONTINUES) (CHUCKLE)
C. Montgomery Burns: (SINGING) HEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER / THEY CALLED ME AL / IT WAS AL ALL THE TIME / HEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER / I'M YOUR PAL / BUDDY, CAN'T YOU SPARE A DIME.
(ROLLS ROYCE: int. rolls royce - night)
Homer Simpson: (TAPPING ON CAR WINDOW) Huh? What th... Uh, Mr. Burns?
C. Montgomery Burns: (STARTLED) Ah!
Homer Simpson: (SMALL SCREAM) Sorry, sir. It's just me, Homer Simpson. Is everything all right?
C. Montgomery Burns: Working late, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Uh... uh yes, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: You and I are a dying breed, Simpson. I'm going to share something with you. Hop in.
Homer Simpson: (BOUNCING ON SEAT) Ooooh, cushy.
C. Montgomery Burns: Homer, they're trying to shut us down.
C. Montgomery Burns: They say we're contaminating the planet.
Homer Simpson: Well, nobody's perfect.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why can't the government just get off our backs?
Homer Simpson: You know, I was just telling the wife that if I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRILY) Oh, get off your soapbox, Simpson! Do you realize how much it costs to run for office? More than any honest man can afford.
Homer Simpson: I bet you could afford it, though.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) Uh... don't get me wrong. I mean you're an honest man. I just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'Course I'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. I mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't.
Homer Simpson: Where are we going, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: To create a new and better world.
Homer Simpson: (TIMIDLY) If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?
Homer Simpson: Well, he's got my vote.
Marge Simpson: Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family.
Homer Simpson: Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Monty Burns.
Lisa Simpson: (BEAMING) Oooo, a political discussion at our table. I feel like a Kennedy.
Marge Simpson: Well, frankly, I don't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against Mary Bailey, the most beloved governor our great state has ever known.
(Burns's Office: int. BURNS' OFFICE - DAY)
Dean Danielson: Now, here's the problem as I see it: While Governor Bailey is beloved by all, ninety-eight percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse. That's why we've assembled the finest campaign team money can buy. (POINTING TO EACH AS HE GOES) This is your speech writer...
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh uh.
Dean Danielson: your joke writer...
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh uh.
Dean Danielson: your spin doctor...
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh uh.
Dean Danielson: your make-up man...
C. Montgomery Burns: Yeah.
Dean Danielson: and your personal trainer.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oooo!
Dean Danielson: Their job... to turn this Mr. Burns...
DANIELSON: ...into this.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why are my teeth showing like that?
DANIELSON: Because you're smiling.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah. Excellent. This is exactly the kind of trickery I'm paying you for. But, but how do we turn your average Joe Sixpack against Mary Bailey?
DANIELSON: With this team of investigators: your muckraker...
C. Montgomery Burns: How do you do.
DANEILSON: Your character assassin...
C. Montgomery Burns: Nice to meet you.
DANEILSON: your mudslinger...
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah...
DANIELSON: your garbologist.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello!
DANIELSON: Their job is to turn Mary Bailey from this...into this.
C. Montgomery Burns: Visual aids help so much. Thank you.
DANIELSON: But first, there's a burning issue that we need to address and neutralize immediately.
C. Montgomery Burns: I hate that fish!
(Springfield Retirement Castle: int. springfield retirement home)
TV Announcer: (FROM TV) Thank you for watching Movie for a Dreary Afternoon. Please stay tuned for a paid political announcement brought to you by the Friends of Montgomery Burns.
Grampa Simpson: Burns! Change the channel.
Jasper Beardly: You change it.
Grampa Simpson: No, you change it.
OLD BEARDED GUY: I changed it last week.
Grampa Simpson: Fine. Be a jerk. Then we'll just sit here and watch it.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Barney Gumble: (RE: TV) Oh, no. An election! That's one of those deals where they close the bars, isn't it?
Moe Szyslak: (NODS) Sorry, Barney.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Marge Simpson: I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Marge. What's the big deal? I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
(TV Studio: int. tv studio)
Waylon Smithers: Thirty seconds to air, Mr. Burns.
DANIELSON: Now, remember to smile.
C. Montgomery Burns: I am smiling.
DANIELSON: You'll have to do better than that.
C. Montgomery Burns: (GRUNTS TWICE) How's this?
DANIELSON: There you go.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm going to be sore tomorrow.
DANIELSON: Well, we've done all we can, Mr. Burns. The rest is up to you.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, don't worry --
C. Montgomery Burns: -- by the time this paid political announcement is done, every Johnny Lunchpail in this whole stupid state will be eating out of my hand.

(Studio: int. studio)
C. Montgomery Burns: (INTO CAMERA, REALIZING) Oh, hello friends. I'm Montgomery Burns, your next governor, and I'm here to talk to you about my little friend, here. Blinky.
C. Montgomery Burns: Many of you consider him to be a hideous genetic mutation. Nothing could be further from the truth. But don't take my word for it. Let's ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin what he thinks.
Charles Darwin: Hello, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh hello, Charles. Be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection.
Charles Darwin: Glad to, Mr. Burns. You see, every so often Mother Nature changes her animals giving them bigger teeth, sharper claws, longer legs or, in this case, a third eye. And if these variations turn out to be an improvement, the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the face of the earth.
C. Montgomery Burns: So... you're saying this fish might have an advantage over other fish. It may, in fact, be a kind of super fish!
Charles Darwin: I wouldn't mind having a third eye, would you?
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES) No. You see, friends... if our anti-nuclear naysayers and choose-up-siders were to come upon an elephant frolicking in the waters next to our nuclear power plant, they'd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman.
C. Montgomery Burns: The truth is this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that can't be beat. Mmmm mmmm. So, to summarize: Say what you want about me. I can take the slings and arrows. But stop slandering poor, defenseless Blinky. Good night and God bless.
Singers: ONLY A MORON/ WOULDN'T CAST HIS VOTE/FOR MONTY BURNS.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Barney Gumble: Wow! Super fish!
Moe Szyslak: I wish the government would get off his back.
(Springfield Retirement Castle: int. springfield retirement home)
Grampa Simpson: That Burns is just what this state needs... young blood.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - LIVING ROOM)
Homer Simpson: I hope Burns and I can count on your support, honey.
Marge Simpson: Homer... (PINS ON BAILEY BUTTON) I'm a Bailey Booster.
Homer Simpson: Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a Burns Booster. (PINS ON BURNS BUTTON; STICKS HIMSELF) Ow!
(Burns's Office: INT. BURNS' OFFICE)
DANIELSON: Congratulations, Mr. Burns. The latest polls show you're up six points.
C. Montgomery Burns: Giving me a total of...
DANIELSON: Six. But we're on our way!
MARY BAILEY: My worthy opponent seems to think that the voters of this state are gullible fools. I, however, prefer to rely on their intelligence and good judgment.
C. Montgomery Burns: And I say taxes are too high!
C. Montgomery Burns: Have you found any dirt on Mary Bailey?
Investigator #1: Well, we've gone through her garbage...
Investigator #2: We've talked to her maid...
Investigator #1: And so far, the only negative thing we have found is from some guy who dated her when she was sixteen.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, and?
Investigator #3: He felt her up.
C. Montgomery Burns: Bah! Not good enough!
C. Montgomery Burns: We're gonna send - a message - to those bureaucrats - down there in the State Capital!
Bart Simpson: Is your boss Governor yet?
Homer Simpson: Not yet, son. Not yet.
DANIELSON: The voters now see you as imperial and God-like.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hot dog!
DANIELSON: But there's a downside to it. The latest polls indicate you're in danger of losing touch with the common man.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SARCASTIC) Oh, dear. Heaven forefend.
DANIELSON: Which is why the night before the election, we want you to have dinner at the home of one of your workers.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh. I get your angle. Every Joe Meatball and Sally Housecoat in this God-forsaken state will see me hunkering down for chow with Eddie Punchclock. The media will have a field day!
DANIELSON: The only question is -- can we find someone common enough...
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISGUSTED) Well, I... I knew there would be sacrifices.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen)
Homer Simpson: (CRUNCH) Ah... great toast, Marge. Hmmm. Oh, by the way, the night before the election Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner.
Marge Simpson: What!
Homer Simpson: And some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them.
Bart Simpson: Cool man! A media circus.
Marge Simpson: Absolutely not!
Homer Simpson: Come on, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Huh uh. I'm going to be ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey that night.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT, THEN FIRMLY) Kids, please leave the room. I don't want you to see this.
Bart Simpson: Uh oh.
Homer Simpson: (DROPPING TO KNEES) Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
DANIELSON: We're hoping that one of the children might pop up with a question about the upcoming election. (HANDS LISA A PIECE OF PAPER) Little girl, do you think you can memorize this by dinner time tomorrow?
Lisa Simpson: (READING OFF PAPER) "Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?"
DANIELSON: Very good.
Lisa Simpson: Hmmm. Well as long as I'm asking something, can I ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable?
DANIELSON: No, dear. The card question will be fine.
Marge Simpson: Well I think the non-card question is a valid one.
Homer Simpson: Marge! (TO DANIELSON) Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, I'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES) Only an innocent child could get away with such blasphemy. God bless them all. Amen.
DANIELSON: And finally, Mr. Burns wants you to appear very affectionate to him. But we must remind you, he hates being touched.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpsons house - night - establishing)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Marge, get back in bed.
Marge Simpson: No, I'm just fine right here.
Homer Simpson: What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.
Marge Simpson: Well, I don't feel like snuggling.
Homer Simpson: What's that got to do with it?
Marge Simpson: I don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself.
Homer Simpson: But you do get to express yourself. In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve.
Marge Simpson: (DEADLY CALM) Okay, Homer. Fair enough. You got it! All right! Good! That's it. That's how I'm gonna express myself. That's right. Goodnight.
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Make-up Man: Well, what do we think?
Homer Simpson: Hey! Hello, handsome!
DANIELSON: Hey, get that stuff off his face. We're here to have dinner with the common man, not Tyrone Power.
Gregor: The latest polls are in. It's dead even -- fifty-fifty. This cornball stunt is gonna put us over the top.
Bart Simpson: Whoa! He's here!
(House: ext. house - front door)
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello, Homer. Marge, you look (PAUSE) dazzling. Oh, and look, I've brought noodle kugel.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY) Bad dog! Bad neighbor dog! Here, let me help you up, Mr. Burns. (GRUNTS)
C. Montgomery Burns: (LAUGHING) I love dogs... babies, too.
C. Montgomery Burns: Aaaah... kitty, kitty.
Homer Simpson: Are you all right, Mr. Burns?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, of course. (THROUGH HIS TEETH) A little roughhousing with the pets is good for a man's appetite.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - dining room)
DANIELSON: (TO BURNS) The latest polls are in. The statesman-like way you handled the pet incident has put you over the top. You're ahead fifty-one to forty-nine. Congratulations, Mr. Governor!
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) Bart, would you like to say grace?
Bart Simpson: Dear God, we paid for all this stuff ourselves, so thanks for nothin'.
(PRESS BOX: INt. PRESS BOX)
DANIELSON: (TO GREGOR) He's smokin'. He's smokin'.
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL, READING) "You know, Mr. Burns, my family and I (BURP) feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?"
C. Montgomery Burns: (FEIGNING SURPRISE) Goodness! I didn't realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate.
Homer Simpson: I was only reading what the card...
C. Montgomery Burns: (OVERRIDING HIM) Homer, I agree with you and, if I'm elected governor (GESTICULATES WILDLY), I will lower taxes whether those bureaucrats in the State capital like it or not.
C. Montgomery Burns: Lisa, do you have a question you would like to ask your Uncle Montgomery?
Lisa Simpson: Yes, sir. A very inane one. (SIGHS, THEN, SLOWLY DYING INSIDE) Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oooh, a tough question, but a fair one. Lisa, there's no single answer. Some voters respond to my integrity. Others are more impressed with my incorruptibility... still others by my determination to lower taxes, and the bureaucrats in the state capital can put that in their pipes and smoke it.
Lisa Simpson: Oh Mom, that felt awful.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, dear. It will all be over soon.
Lisa Simpson: But Mom, we've become the tools of evil.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt.
C. Montgomery Burns: ...some can't even get a fair shake, or even a square deal... Ummmm, smells delightful.
Bart Simpson: All right! Three eyed fish!
Marge Simpson: Can I have your plate, Mr. Burns?
DANIELSON: Ruined before it hit the ground.
Reporter #1: Get me the city desk...
Reporter #2: (INTO PHONE) Here's your headline, Phil: "Burns Can't Swallow Own Story."
Scott Christian: The latest polls indicate Burns' popularity has plummeted to earth like so much half-chewed fish.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO DANIELSON & GREGOR) You must have a few tricks left up your sleeves. (ROLLS UP SLEEVES) Smithers, boil some coffee. We're not licked yet.
DANIELSON: Yes, we are. Come on boys, the old guy's finished.
C. Montgomery Burns: (RISING FRENZY) Wait! Come back! You can't do this to me! I'm Charles Montgomery Burns!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, tip over this table for me!
Waylon Smithers: Yes sir.
Marge Simpson: (LOW) Homer... Homer... make them stop.
Homer Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT THEN, VERY POLITELY) Uh, Mr. Burns... Uh, Mr. Burns...
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up and wreck something.
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Burns, I hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SIGHS) She's right. Take me home, Smithers. We'll destroy something tasteful.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO SMITHERS) Ironic, isn't it Smithers? This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes has cost me the election, and yet if I were to have them killed, I would be the one to go to jail. That's democracy for you.
Waylon Smithers: You are noble and poetic in defeat, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO HOMER) Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled.
Bart Simpson: Uh oh. You're busted, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled! Oh no. I don't like the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, make it better. Please. Can't you make it better, huh?
Marge Simpson: Homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling, and sleeping till noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them.
Homer Simpson: Hey, you did it!
(Moe's Tavern: int. Moe's tavern - night)
Barney Gumble: So, Homer. What happened in Capitol City?
Homer Simpson: Aw, Barney.
Moe Szyslak: Come on, Homer. We're dyin' of curiosity.
Homer Simpson: Look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. It's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. And I never want that to happen to me.
Barney Gumble: Please, Homer.
Moe Szyslak: C'mom, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Well, okay. It all started on "Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night," down at Springfield stadium.
(STADIUM: ext. stadium - evening)

Homer Simpson: You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day.
Bart Simpson: What? Aren't we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers?
Homer Simpson: Sure, we get a nice mix here.
Lisa Simpson: I can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard. There's just the green grass of the outfield, the crushed brick of the infield, and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here.
Marge Simpson: I hope you'll space out the tubs this year, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) What are you getting at?
Marge Simpson: Well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire.
Homer Simpson: Marge, (HOLDING UP THE TICKET) this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, the Gammills. Good to see you.

Homer Simpson: Uh... Simp-sons, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONSULTING CARD) Huh? Hmmm, oh, oh yes... Homer and Marge Simpson. Oh, and these must be Bart, Lisa and uh, "Expecting".

FLASH: Hey there, little lady. What can Flash do for ya?
Marge Simpson: Here you go, Bart.

P.A. Announcer: (HEAVILY ECHOED) Ladies and gentlemen, throwing out tonight's first ball, the man whose name is synonymous with our nation's safest and cleanest energy source, Mr. Montgomery Burns!
Waylon Smithers: Ah, they love you, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Heh, heh. As well they might. You know, Smithers, when I was a young buck, my patented fadeaway pitch was compared by many to the "trouble ball" of the late great Satchel Paige. Spit on this for me, Smithers.
Waylon Smithers: One hocker coming up, sir.
Bart Simpson: What a lame-o!
Waylon Smithers: I could actually hear the air being torn, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, shut up.

C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, sitting with the employees. I guess this proves I'm their friend. (THEN) You did get me something on an aisle, Smithers? I don't want to be surrounded by them.
Homer Simpson: Let's go now... Sa-winggg, batter!
Bart Simpson: We want a pitcher / Not a belly itcher!
Lisa Simpson: We want a catcher / Not a belly scratcher!
Waylon Smithers: Here we are, sir.
Homer Simpson: (SOTTO) Oh, no. Marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! (GRUMBLING) Of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks...
Marge Simpson: All this means is you can't wave your fanny in public.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Rub it in.
Vendor: Beeer heah! Duff Beeer
Vendor: VENDOR (O.S.) HOMER
Vendor: Get your Duff Beer (WISTFULLY SOTTO)
Vendor: heah! Beer, right Beer. Didja hear
Vendor: here! Duff Beer! that, Marge?
Homer Simpson: Delicious frosty beer. Fat lot of good that does me, sitting next to old man Burns.
Marge Simpson: (WARNING) Now, Homer.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO HOMER) I suppose you want a beer?
Homer Simpson: Me, sir? Oh, no. Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer.
C. Montgomery Burns: Actually, I was wondering if you'd join me. My treat.
Homer Simpson: Ohhh. Well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm all turned around on the subject. Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?
C. Montgomery Burns: No. (TO VENDOR) Vendor, two, please.
VENDER: Two-fifty.
(BALL PARK: ext. ball park - later)
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHANTING) THE HITTER'S OFF HIS ROCKER / KISSING BETTY CROCKER!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Good one, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh well, I used to rile the late, great Connie Mack with that one at old Shibe Park.
Homer Simpson: (CHANTING) LITTLE BABY BATTER / CAN'T CONTROL HIS BLADDER! (LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: Will you shut up, I'm trying to think of a name.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmmm. Crude, but I like it. (THEN, HOLDING UP 72 OZ. TUB) What do you say we freshen up our little drinkie poos?
Homer Simpson: Don't mind if I do.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, Simpsie, you up for another wave?
Homer Simpson: All right, Burnsie.
Dan Hoard: Bases loaded. 'Topes have one out, down by three. Here's the pitch. Swung on and missed! Strike three. Of course.
C. Montgomery Burns: Damnation! These banjos couldn't carry Pie Traynor's glove.
Dan Hoard: Big Bill McCloskey coming up. As soon as he pops out, we'll go right to the post-game show.
Homer Simpson: C'mon! All we need is a grand slam.
C. Montgomery Burns: My one game of the year... ruined by pathetic incompetence.
Homer Simpson: What's wrong with you people? Let's show some spirit! Come on, get up!
Homer Simpson: (TO THE CROWD) Your team needs you! C'mon!!!
Homer Simpson: As I got up in front of them, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle.
Dan Hoard: ... There's some nut down in right field, dancin' up a storm! He's really got the crowd goin'. Let's see if he can shake up mediocre slugger "Big Bill" McCloskey.
Dan Hoard: Swung on and belted to deep left field! It's going... going...
Dan Hoard: It's gone! It's outta here! Oh, my God, the Isotopes win a game! The Isotopes win a game! The Isotopes win a game!
Waylon Smithers: Well, that was certainly exciting.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes. Unfortunately, Homer Simpson's shameless display of exhibitionism tainted the entire evening. I want him banned for life from all company outings.
Waylon Smithers: (LAUGHS)
(Parking Lot: ext. parking lot - moments later)
Homer Simpson: I thank you. You're too kind. Glad you enjoyed it, but I can't take all the credit. The batter did his part, too.
MR. O'HARA: Excuse me... You, sir -- the dancing fella. I'm Antoine "Tex" O'Hara. I own the Isotopes. Would you be interested in becoming our official mascot?
Homer Simpson: M-- me? A mascot for a bush league team?
Homer Simpson: I should have slept on it. Or at least stared blankly for a while. Perhaps if I'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared.
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm ready to punch in.
Bart Simpson: Oh, oh. Hey, cool, man.
Lisa Simpson: Our lives have taken an odd turn.
Marge Simpson: Did the team ask you to dress like that, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Nope, this was my own bright idea. (THEN) C'mon, we gotta hurry. Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos.
Homer Simpson: For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me.
Dan Hoard: 'Topes win! 'Topes win! Two in a row! Two in a row!
Marge Simpson: A Simpson on a T-shirt. I never thought I'd see the day.
Homer Simpson: Oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. Woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie.
Player #2: Hey, knock that off or I'll stick this bat where the sun don't shine.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah? And where might that be? (REALIZING) Oh.
Homer Simpson: Helen, I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight. How 'bout giving me "Baby Elephant Walk" with a little reggae kinda beat?
Rasta #1: Go, "Dancin' Homer"! Git up man, git up!
Rasta #2: Lively up yourself, Dancin' Homer.
(BALLPARK: ext. ballpark - evening)
Dan Hoard: Bases loaded, two outs. The good guys trail by a run.
Dan Hoard: Here's the pitch... swung on and missed -- strike three. (DEPRESSED) 'Topes lose... 'Topes lose...'Topes lose...
(OWNER'S OFFICE: int. owner's office - minutes later)
Homer Simpson: You wanted to see me, "Tex"?
MR. O'HARA: Homer, now we both knew when you began doing this you weren't gonna be here forever...
Homer Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick.
MR. O'HARA: Homer, I'm not firing you. I just got the word -- You've been called up to Capital City.
Homer Simpson: Me? In the majors?
MR. O'HARA: That's right.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Capital City has a mascot. The greatest mascot there is: The Capital City "Goofball".
MR. O'HARA: Yeah, but he's getting on in years and he needs someone to fill in for a couple of innings a night. Could be a big opportunity for you.
Homer Simpson: I'll say!
MR. O'HARA: Why don't you talk it over with your family?
Homer Simpson: (WHINING) Because they might say no.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's bar - continuous)
Homer Simpson: This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced. I should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.
Homer Simpson: I shouldn't have called her that. Bite my tongue. Bite my tongue. (BITES TONGUE) Oooh.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson HOUSE - LIVING ROOM)
Lisa Simpson: I can't leave Springfield. I was born here and I thought I would die here.
Homer Simpson: It won't be so bad. You'll die someplace else.
Bart Simpson: Well, what am I supposed to do about friends?
Homer Simpson: Phfft. You'll make new and better friends.
Lisa Simpson: But, Dad. We're simple people with simple values. Capital City is too big and too complex. Everyone in Springfield knows us and has forgiven us.
Marge Simpson: Homer, I'd be lying if I didn't say that this scares me a little. But we all have a calling, a reason The Almighty put us on this Earth. And yours might be to dance on dugouts.
Homer Simpson: You mean -- ?
Marge Simpson: Let's do it, Homer!
Bart Simpson: Yeah, let's blow this pop stand and never look back.
Lisa Simpson: Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
Homer Simpson: It's not that simple. I've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. nuclear plant - day)
Supervisor: Sure. What would you like -- four years? Five years?
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day)
NED: So, Simpson. You're really moving to Capital City?
Homer Simpson: That's right, Ned.
NED: (INDICATING STUFF ON LAWN) Uh huh. And all this stuff is for sale, huh? You know, I-I-I... don't know how to say this, but, well...
Homer Simpson: Oh, knock it off, Flanders! Don't start blubbering on me. I'm gonna miss you too... (UNDER IS BREATH) not.
(Bart's Treehouse: int. treehouse - day)
Milhouse Van Houten: I don't know, Bart. I mean, I'm gonna miss you and all, but...
Bart Simpson: Come on, Milhouse. This way we'll be friends forever.
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, okay.
Milhouse Van Houten: Ewww!
Bart Simpson: I'm gonna miss you, spit brother.
Milhouse Van Houten: I'm gonna miss you, spit brother.
(Springfield Elementary School Yard: ext. schoolyard - another section)
Lisa Simpson: I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, my leaving would actually have meant something.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day)
Marge Simpson: Well, we have one quick stop and then it's on to Capital City.
Patty Bouvier: I can't believe it. Our baby sister in the big city.
Selma Bouvier: I'll call you every day.
Patty Bouvier: I'll call you, too.
Patty Bouvier: Look, he can use a horn.
Selma Bouvier: (TO HOMER) Oh, shut up.
(BALLPARK: ext. ballpark - night)
Homer Simpson: ... Some may say that I have been given a bad break in life -- little education, bald as a cue ball, ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today, as I leave for Capital City, I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the Earth!
Homer Simpson: With the fickle fans already forgetting me, I was ready to take the biggest step of my life.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(Highway: ext. highway - day)
(Capital City: ext. capital city - night)
Homer Simpson: Well kids, there it is, Capital City.
Marge Simpson: Look! The Crosstown Bridge!
Bart Simpson: Wow!
Homer Simpson: Wow!
Tony Bennett: "THERE'S A SWINGIN' TOWN I KNOW /
Tony Bennett: CALLED CAPITAL CITY..."
Lisa Simpson: The Pennyloafer!
Tony Bennett: "PEOPLE STOP AND SCREAM HELLO /
Tony Bennett: IN CAPITAL CITY..."
Homer Simpson: Kids, look! Street crime!
Tony Bennett: "IT'S THE KIND OF PLACE THAT MAKES
Tony Bennett: A BUM / FEEL LIKE A KING..."
Homer Simpson: Wow! That's service!
Tony Bennett: "AND IT MAKES A KING FEEL LIKE/
Tony Bennett: SOME NUTTY KOO-KOO SUPER-KING..."
Marge Simpson: Look, it's Tony Bennett!
Tony Bennett: Hey, good to see you.
Tony Bennett: "IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO FROWN /
Marge Simpson: Oh, well, we're all out, Homer.
Tony Bennett: IN CAPITAL CITY. "YOU'LL CAPER LIKE A STUPID CLOWN / WHEN YOU CHANCE TO SEE..."
Marge Simpson: Fourth Street and D!
Tony Bennett: "...FOURTH STREET AND D!/ YEAH!/ ONCE YOU GET A WHIFF OF IT...YOU'LL NEVER WANT TO ROAM."
Homer Simpson: (REVERENTIAL) The Duff Brewery!
Tony Bennett: FROM CAPITAL CITY, MY HOME SWEET HOME / CAPITAL CITY... THAT HAPPYTOWN CITY / IT'S CAPITAL CITY, MY HOME, SWEET, SWINGIN' HOME"
Lisa Simpson: Capital City -- yeah!
(Hotel Room: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: Awww. Come to bed, Homie.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, honey. I'm just a little nervous.
Homer Simpson: We would talk about it always. For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did.
(Capital City Cap Dome: ext. capital city cap dome - dusk)
Homer Simpson: Okay, here are your tickets. They're supposed to be good. You're sitting with the player's wives. And don't forget to cheer for me.
Marge Simpson: See you after the game, when you're a big star.
Homer Simpson: Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.
(CAP CITY DOME: INT. CAP CITY DOME)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Wow.
Homer Simpson: Omigod! I don't believe it. It's really you, the Capital City "Goofball."
Capital City Goofball: Hello, Dancin' Homer. Glad to have you aboard. If there's anything I can do for you (POINTS TO HIS BIG NOSE) just squeeze the wheeze.
(Locker Room: int. locker room - evening)
Capital City Goofball: The fifth inning will be yours. Everyone is settled in, they've had a coupla beers; the game is official. It's a pretty important inning.
Homer Simpson: Wow, the fifth.
Capital City Goofball: It's also the inning I wish I had a zipper on the front of this thing, if you know what I mean.
Homer Simpson: Right, Mr. Goofball.
Capital City Goofball: Hey, call me plain ol' "Goof". So what exactly do you have planned for us?
Homer Simpson: Well, I get up, I dance, I spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of Baby Elephant Walk.
Capital City Goofball: Aah, Mancini. The mascot's best friend. Well, see you on that field. I'll set 'em up, you knock 'em down.
(CAP DOME: int. cap dome - almost gametime)
Dave Glass: Well, hello, everybody. Dave Glass talkin' at ya. We've got great weather here tonight under the Dome.
Marge Simpson: Let's see. Upper, upper, upper mezzanine. Hmmm. Yes, these must be ours.
Bart Simpson: These seats stink!
Marge Simpson: You'd think the player's wives would be a little closer to the action.
First Wife #3: Actually, this section is for the player's ex-wives.
First Wife #1: (TO WOMAN NEXT TO HER) And then I found out that all the while there was this bimbo in Kansas City.
First Wife #3: Throw at his head!
Homer Simpson: Who'd've thought it? A free ticket to a big league park but I was too tense to enjoy the game. Every ounce of concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.
Hot Dog Man: Red hots! Get your read hots here!
Homer Simpson: Oooh, red hots.
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen. Capital City's newest sensation, Dancin' Homer!
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. (WITH HIS MOUTH FULL) Uh oh.
Lisa Simpson: (POINTING) There he is!
Homer Simpson: I was graceful. I was witty. Brother, I was somethin'.
Homer Simpson: But they didn't care.
Bart Simpson: What's with these people? Why are they sitting on their hands?
Lisa Simpson: Mom, what's he doing wrong?
Marge Simpson: I don't know.
Homer Simpson: It was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.
Spectator #1: This guy doesn't make me want to cheer.
Spectator #2: Gee, I really pity him. Making a fool of himself in front of so many people.
Spectator #3: These cornball antics may play in the sticks, but this is Capital City!
Homer Simpson: The only applause I got was for dragging my carcass out of there.
Clubhouse Attendant: Hey, Mr. Showmanship! The owner wants to see you in his office right now.
Dave Rosenfield: I'm sorry, young man; you're just not ready. Pick up your check at the front office... and for God's sake, put some clothes on!
(STADIUM: ext. stadium - players and mascot entrance)
Bart Simpson: Well, I guess it's back to good old Springfield.
Marge Simpson: Would you like some fruit juice?
BURNS LAWYER: No.
Lisa Simpson: But I can't go back! Not after I've seen the bright lights of Capital City. I'll wither and die like a hothouse flower.
Marge Simpson: Now stop it you two. And don't look too down. I'm sure this is hard enough for your father.
Homer Simpson: What a family.
(Freeway: ext. freeway - night)
Homer Simpson: My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home I realized how little that helped.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Homer Simpson: (SIGHS) So that's it. The costume's buried now. As my son would say, I'm one sad ape-like dude.
Barney Gumble: Wow.
Moe Szyslak: What a saga.
Homer Simpson: Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I've become the center of attention.
Barney Gumble: Yeah, it's riveting. (BURP)
Moe Szyslak: Tell it again, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Okay. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
Moe Szyslak: I don't know. They just do.
(Simpson Front Yard: EXT. SIMPSON front yard - SATURDAY AFTERNOON)
Homer Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Bust my hump all week... stupid grass... supposed to be the boy's job.
Marge Simpson: Now, now, Homer. Bart's busy working on his science project.
Bart Simpson: You heard the lady, Homer. So please mow quietly. Genius at work.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bart's bedroom)
Bart Simpson: (WRITING) "One o'clock -- still just a potato.
Ned Flanders: (PLEASANTLY) Hey there, neighbor! The Lord's certainly given us a beautiful day today. Huh?
Homer Simpson: (NOT REAL FRIENDLY) H'lo, Flanders.
Ned Flanders: Doing a little yard work, huh?
Homer Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Who told? (CALLING TO MARGE) Marge! Beer me!
Ned Flanders: Say Simpson, I-I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif.
Homer Simpson: Crabgrass? What are you talking about? Where?
Ned Flanders: Well, (POINTING) ooh, there... there... and uh there's a big patch over there.
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) There's nothing wrong with crabgrass! It just has a bad name, that's all. Everyone would love it if it had a cute name like... uh... elfgrass.
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Well, you may be right!
Homer Simpson: (HOLLERING) Marge! Where's the Duff?
Homer Simpson: (THROUGH HIS TEETH) Don't toy with me, woman.
Ned Flanders: Couldn't help overhearing, Simpson. I've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me.
Homer Simpson: Well, uh, okay. What the heck, I've earned a little break.
(Flanders Home: int. flanders house - basement/rUMPUS ROOm - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Holy moly! It's... it's... beautiful!
Ned Flanders: Say, that's right. This is your first visit to the Flanders homestead.
Homer Simpson: Well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, (COUNTING ALL OF HIS FINGERS) one, two, three, four... eight years.
Ned Flanders: There's my little Popcorn Ball. Kissy, kissy.
Maude Flanders: Hello, Sponge Cake. I thought you boys might be hungry, so I whipped up some club sandwiches.
Ned Flanders: Ain't she wonderful, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, Flanders?
Ned Flanders: Oh, your beer. Uh, is draft okay? Just put in the tap last week.
Ned Flanders: Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland.
Homer Simpson: Well, beggars can't be choosy.
Todd Flanders: Hey, Dad, thanks for helping me with my science project. (KISSES HIS FATHER)
Ned Flanders: My pleasure, Study Buddy.
Todd Flanders: I've got the best Dad in the whole world.
Ned Flanders: (CHIDING) Oh, you know how that embarrasses me.
Todd Flanders: I know. T'oodley doodley.
Ned Flanders: (TO HOMER) Ah, kids can be a trial sometimes.
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) All right, knock it off!
Ned Flanders: Uh, knock what off, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here. Your family is better than my family. Your beer comes from farther away than my beer. You and your son like each other. Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. You make me sick!
Ned Flanders: (FORMALLY) Simpson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand.
Homer Simpson: I wouldn't stay on a bet!
Homer Simpson: One for the road.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Marge Simpson: Homie, quit tossing.
Bart Simpson: Play it where it lays, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, Marge. But it's just that I'm still steamed up about that jerk Flanders. (GRUMBLING) Lousy... bragging... know-it-all... show-off...
Marge Simpson: What exactly did he say?
Homer Simpson: Get this. He said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!
Marge Simpson: Well, how did he say it?
Homer Simpson: (MUTTERING) Well... he...
Marge Simpson: Was he angry?
Homer Simpson: No.
Marge Simpson: Was he rude?
Homer Simpson: Okay, okay. It wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!
Marge Simpson: Homer, I'm your best friend, but I've gotta say, I've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor.
Homer Simpson: Oh, he's perfect now, is he?
Marge Simpson: Well, he's not perfect, but he is very...
Homer Simpson: No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You were right the first time. He's perfect. Perfect in every way.
Homer Simpson: I'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. I got a little excited. (POINTED) I'm not perfect... like Ned Flanders.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
(Flanders Home: int. flanders house - master bedroom - continuous)
Maude Flanders: Neddie, you're tossing. What's the matter?
Ned Flanders: I feel terrible.
Maude Flanders: Mmmm, hmmm...
Ned Flanders: Sometimes I forget that we have things a little better than the Simpsons. I drag him over here. He has a few beers. You can't blame him for erupting.
Maude Flanders: Mmmm, hmmm.
Ned Flanders: And then I turn into a snarling beast. Talk about flunking the old turn-the-other-cheek test!
Maude Flanders: Well, Ned, maybe I'm not the one you should be talking to.
NED: You're right.
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Reverend Lovejoy.
(Lovejoy Bedroom: int. reverend lovejoy's bedroom)
Helen Lovejoy: (INTO PHONE) No, this is Mrs. Lovejoy. Just a minute. (TO REVEREND) Honey, honey, wake up. It sounds like Ned Flanders is having some sort of crisis.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ugh, probably stepped on a worm. (INTO PHONE) Hello, Ned.
Ned Flanders: Hey, there's Homer Simpson! Oh, what a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter.
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) Reverend, I'm sorry to bother you at this hour but I threw a man out of my house today. I feel like I've violated Matthew 19:19.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (INTO PHONE) Huh?
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) "Love thy neighbor."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (INTO PHONE) Oh. Oh. Matthew, 19:19, yeah, right, right. Well, you know, Ned. The Good Book says a gentle answer turneth away wrath.
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) A gentle answer. Well, that is a jim-dandy idea. Bless you, Reverend.
Ned Flanders: (WRITING) "Dear Neighbor..."
(Simpson Home: ext. Simpson house - night)
Homer Simpson: Flanders!
Ned Flanders: I don't blame you for being upset with me, Homer. I just wanted to give you this letter. I'll leave now.
Homer Simpson: (READING) "Dear neighbor... "
Homer Simpson: (READING, LAUGHING) "You are my brother. I love you (LAUGHS) and yet I feel a great sadness (BEAT) in my bosom."
Homer Simpson: Wait! Wait! There's more...
Marge Simpson: I think it's terrible. A man opens his heart and you make fun of him.
Homer Simpson: (READING, LAUGHING) "Neighbors forever. Oh, no! Ned Flanders."
Bart Simpson: What a sap!
Lisa Simpson: Read the bosom part again, Dad.
Marge Simpson: Now, just a minute.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHING) Bosom!
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Huh?
Marge Simpson: I wish this family was as close as the Flanders.
Homer Simpson: Okay, okay, all right, all right. She's right! Let's do something together. What does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?
Bart Simpson: All right!
Marge Simpson: Hmmm. I was going to wash my hair.
Lisa Simpson: And I'm studying for the Math Fair. If I win, I'll bring home a brand new protractor.
Homer Simpson: Too bad we don't live on a farm. (TO BART) Let's go, boy.

Homer Simpson: (WHINY PROTEST) But I got it in the middle!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) That was just a practice shot, boy.
Bart Simpson: Give up, Homeboy. There's a six-stroke limit.
Homer Simpson: I know, I know. I can still make this for five. (CONCENTRATES) Come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. Pleeze. (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Ned Flanders: Hi, Simpson! Having fun?
Homer Simpson: Flanders! What are you doing here?
Ned Flanders: Ah, just playing a little mini-golf with the Todd-meister.
Todd Flanders: (FRIENDLY) Hi, Bart!
Bart Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Get bent.
Ned Flanders: Say, now that we're all friends again, why don't we make a foursome?
Ned Flanders: All right! This will be fun! Oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there.
Homer Simpson: That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it.
Todd Flanders: It is difficult, Mr. Simpson. The best strategy is to play conservatively. Hug the rail. It won't go in, but you set yourself up for an easy deuce.
Todd Flanders: Oh, well, huh, it went in.
Ned Flanders: Good shot, Toddsky!
Homer Simpson: (ASIDE TO BART) Luck.
Bart Simpson: Final score: Bart, forty-one. Homer... let's see, six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six...
Homer Simpson: Never mind!
Todd Flanders: Hey, look!
Todd Flanders: Wow! First prize, fifty dollars!
Bart Simpson: Wow! Free balloons for everyone who enters!
Ned Flanders: So, my little Bartley, thinking of entering the tournament?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, he's entering and what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?
Bart Simpson: (HALFHEARTEDLY) I guess it's possible.
Ned Flanders: Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah! Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week.
Homer Simpson: Come on, boy.
Bart Simpson: But Dad, I've never won anything in my life.
Homer Simpson: Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this. It is not okay to lose.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BACKYARD - THE NEXT MORNING)
Marge Simpson: (IRRITATED) You brought food...
Homer Simpson: (TO SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER) Stay, stay. Good dog. Now, keep your head down.
Homer Simpson: No, not you. I'm talking to the boy. (TO BART) Keep your head down. Follow through...
Homer Simpson: Okay, that didn't work. This time move your head and don't follow through.
Bart Simpson: Oh, man.
Homer Simpson: (OUTRAGED) What're you doing? That putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player, what a violin is to the guy tha...the violin guy. Now, c'mon, give your putter a name.
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: Come on, give it a name.
Bart Simpson: (TIMIDLY) Mr. Putter.
Homer Simpson: Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on, give it a girl's name.
Bart Simpson: Mom.
Homer Simpson: (GRUFFLY) Your putter's name is Charlene!
Bart Simpson: Why?
Homer Simpson: It just is. That's why.
Homer Simpson: Now, this is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders. Every day I want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him.
Bart Simpson: Who's Charlene?
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) I'll show you who Charlene is! Now start hating!
Todd Flanders: (FRIENDLY) Hi, Bart.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - day)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I couldn't help overhearing you warp Bart's mind.
Homer Simpson: And?
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament.
Homer Simpson: But, Marge, this is our big chance to show up the Flanderses.
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?
Homer Simpson: Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. (BITTERLY) And I'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
(Bart's Bedroom: int. bart's bedroom - day)

Bart Simpson: Absolutely. Eeeeeeeer! (CRASH SOUND)
(Street: EXT. street - DAY)
Lisa Simpson: Well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but I think you're referring to a pawn.
Bart Simpson: Right. I am a pawn.
Lisa Simpson: I know. It's times like this that I'm thankful Dad has little to no interest in almost everything I do. Bart, I think I can help you.

Lisa Simpson: Let's see, "golf"... Anecdotes, Eisenhower and, Fashion, Humor, Japanese Obsession With... ah, here it is. Putting.
(LIBRARY STACKS: int. library stacks - oriental philosophy section - later)
Lisa Simpson: And, finally, the most important book of all, The Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu.
Bart Simpson: Lisa, we can't afford all these books.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, we're just gonna borrow them.
Bart Simpson: (WINKS; SLYLY) Oh, heh, heh. Gotcha.
(Lake Springfield: ext. lake springfield - day)
Lisa Simpson: I want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.
Bart Simpson: Okay.
Lisa Simpson: Embrace nothingness.
Bart Simpson: You got it.
Lisa Simpson: Become like an uncarved stone.
Bart Simpson: Done.
Lisa Simpson: Bart! You're just pretending to know what I'm talking about.
Bart Simpson: True.
Lisa Simpson: Well, it's very frustrating.
Bart Simpson: I'll bet.
(TOP OF MOUNT SPRINGFIELD: ext. top of mount springfield - day)
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I have a riddle for you: What's the sound of one hand clapping?
Bart Simpson: Piece of cake.
Lisa Simpson: No, Bart. It's a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer. It's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought.
Bart Simpson: No answer? Lisa, listen up.
Lisa Simpson: Let's try another one: If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?
Homer Simpson: I said NOW!
Lisa Simpson: But Bart, how can a sound exist if there's no one there to hear it?
Bart Simpson: Woooooooo!
Lisa Simpson: It is time.
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - day)
Lisa Simpson: The basis of this game seems to be simple geometry. All you have to do is hit the ball here.
Bart Simpson: I can't believe it... You've actually found a practical use for geometry.
Homer Simpson: Bart! What're you doing? Get down from there before the neighbors see --
Ned Flanders: Hey, Simpson.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Flanders, I don't care what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt.
Ned Flanders: (CLINGING TO HIS DECENCY) Well, sir, may the best man win.
Homer Simpson: Ah, "may the best man win". The mating call of the loser.
Ned Flanders: Now, just a minute, Simpson. I think my son has a very good chance.
Homer Simpson: Oh, yeah? Wanna bet?
Ned Flanders: Yeah, well, I'm not a betting man.
Ned Flanders: Oh, I'm a chicken, am I?
Homer Simpson: That's right!
Ned Flanders: All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!
Homer Simpson: What, are you afraid to make a real bet?
Ned Flanders: No, I just --
Ned Flanders: (GETTING ANGRY) You know, Simpson, you're starting to annoy me.
Homer Simpson: How about this Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn.
Ned Flanders: (EVEN ANGRIER) All right, and if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a change!
Homer Simpson: Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress.
Ned Flanders: (SCREAMING) You have yourself a bet, you (BEAT) jackaninny!
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - day)
Homer Simpson: Read that back to me, Marge.
Marge Simpson: (READS) "The father of the loser mows the lawn -- "
Ned Flanders: (INTERRUPTS) Eh, eh, just a minute. "Loser" is such a harsh word. Couldn't we just say "the boy who doesn't win"?
Homer Simpson: Oh man. Fine.
Marge Simpson: (WRITING) "The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress."
Ned Flanders: There you go.
Marge Simpson: Now I suppose you both have to sign this. I hope blood won't be necessary.
Homer Simpson: I'm game if you are, Flanders.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - minutes later)
Ned Flanders: (SIGHS) Good gravy, what have I done?
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - day)
Homer Simpson: Keep your left arm straight, Bart... rotate your shoulders...
Lisa Simpson: Dad!
Homer Simpson: (GENTLY) Look, son, all I'm asking is that you try.
Bart Simpson: Okay, I'll try.
Homer Simpson: (SCORNFUL) Anybody can try! I want you to win!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Marge Simpson: Homer?!
Homer Simpson: Marge, give me your honest opinion. (HOLDS UP A DRESS) This? (HOLDS UP THE OTHER ONE) Or this?
(Springfield: ext. Springfield - establishing - dawn)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bart's bedroom)
Homer Simpson: Good morning, son! Oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!
Lisa Simpson: Dad!
Homer Simpson: See you downstairs, boy.
Homer Simpson: Heh heh... that crazy Marmaduke...
Lisa Simpson: Eighth hole.
Bart Simpson: (AUTOMATICALLY) Aim for the Octopus' third tentacle.
Lisa Simpson: Twelfth hole.
Bart Simpson: Bank it off the pink tombstone.
Lisa Simpson: Nirvana.
Bart Simpson: A state of bliss attained through the extinction of the self.
Marge Simpson: Here you go, Bart. A lumberjack's breakfast for my little golfer.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, Bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates. Steak will make him logy.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh, well, what won't make him logy?
Lisa Simpson: Oatmeal.
Homer Simpson: Oatmeal?
Lisa Simpson: Oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the Kentucky Derby.
Homer Simpson: News flash, Lisa! Bart is not a horse. Eat your steak, boy.
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - afternoon)
Bart Simpson: Mom, do I have to?
British Commentator: Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the finale of what has already been a stirring afternoon of miniature golf. The cream has risen, the wheat has bid farewell to the chaff, and now we approach the championship match with but two warriors remaining: The heretofore unknown Bart Simpson, and Todd Flanders, one of the most skilled ten-year-olds to ever take back the blade.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself, I'm not sure how they're supposed to sound. But here goes. I believe in you.
Bart Simpson: Thanks, man!
Homer Simpson: Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying. I already did the same thing, and we can't both win.
Ned Flanders: (THROUGH CLENCHED TEETH) Actually, Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt.
Homer Simpson: Oh... Well, Flan-ders, it doesn't matter. This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels.
Ned Flanders: No, you will.
Homer Simpson: 'Fraid not.
Ned Flanders: 'Fraid so.
Homer Simpson: 'Fraid not.
Ned Flanders: 'Fraid so.
Homer Simpson: (SMUGLY) 'Fraid not infinity.
Ned Flanders: 'Fraid so infinity plus one.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(MINIATURE GOLF: ext. miniature golf - first hole - continuous)
British Commentator: Young Flanders has the honor and will tee off first.
British Commentator: It's got a chance... (BALL GOES IN) Yes, sir!
Bart Simpson: (DESPAIRINGLY) Oh, man...
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in...
British Commentator: And the battle is well and truly joined!
Homer Simpson: Woo-hoo-hoo! (TO FLANDERS)
Ned Flanders: (TO TODD) Mercy is for the weak, Todd.
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - hole 18 - late afternoon)
British Commentator: If one were to look up "courage" in the Oxford English Dictionary, one might very well come upon a photo of these two gladiators. They approach the final hole in the shadow of the great emancipator, deadlocked at eight strokes on the happy side of par. Soon, one man will emerge triumphant. He will drink naught but champagne, while his opponent tastes bitter defeat in this oft cruel game.
Ned Flanders: It's okay, son. You can recover.
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF, PLEADING) Come on, Bart. Remember what Vince Lombardi said: "If you lose, you're out of the family."
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Ow.
British Commentator: Neither man showing his best form... This sort of pressure can unhinge even the steeliest of competitors.
Bart Simpson: This is pretty tense, isn't it, Todd?
Todd Flanders: Yeah, my knees are shaking, I've got butterflies in my stomach... but I guess this builds character.
Bart Simpson: Who wants to build character. Let's quit.
Todd Flanders: Okay.
Todd Flanders: We decided we're equally good.
Bart Simpson: We want to call it a draw, man.
British Commentator: (ANNOUNCING) Ladies and gentlemen, we have a draw!
British Commentator: (TEARFULLY) You will forgive an old Brit for crying, but this is the most stirring display of gallantry and sportsmanship since Mountbatten gave India back to the Punjabs.
Bart Simpson: Put her there, man!
Todd Flanders: Yeah, all right!
Ned Flanders: Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. (CHUCKLES) Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. (EXTENDING HIS HAND) Put 'er there, pal.
Homer Simpson: Ohhh, so you're gonna welch on our bet?!
Ned Flanders: What are you talking about? Neither boy lost.
Homer Simpson: I got it right here in writing.
Homer Simpson: (READING) "The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress."
Ned Flanders: (DISBELIEVING) But... neither, I mean we're both... I mean, you have to do it too.
Homer Simpson: It's a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself.
(SIMPSON AND FLANDERS HOUSES: ext. simpson and flanders houses - day)
Marge Simpson: (MOANING) Oh, my best dress.
Lisa Simpson: Why do I get the feeling that someday I'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?
Homer Simpson: Listen to 'em laughing... This is so humiliating... I'm never gonna live this down... Damn Flanders...
Homer Simpson: Halftime, Marge, halftime.
Patty Bouvier: Ding-dong!
Ned Flanders: (LAUGHING) Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Oh my God! He's enjoying it!
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: (MUFFLED) Bart, cut it out!
Homer Simpson: Bart! Stop fighting with your sister!
Bart Simpson: She took my glue!
Lisa Simpson: It's not yours, Bart! This is family glue!
Homer Simpson: Stop it, you two! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, this isn't about glue. It's about territoriality. He only wants the glue because I'm using it.
Bart Simpson: Oh yeah? Prove it!
Lisa Simpson: Here.
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, I don't want your stupid glue.
Marty: (FROM TV) Uh-oh. Here comes our friend, Bullwinkle J. Moose...
Homer Simpson: Heh... heh... heh. Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.
Bill: (FROM TV; RE: ANTLER) Uh-oh... it looks like ol' Bullwinkle's kinda got a taste of his own medicine!
Marty: (FROM TV) (LAUGHING) He certainly did, Bill!
Bill: (FROM TV; TO SELF) Wait, what did that mean? Did what I say make sense?
Marty: (FROM TV) Well... no... not really, Bill!
Bill: (FROM TV; CHUCKLES) Boy, now I know how the Pilgrims felt.
Marty: (FROM TV) What're you talking about, Bill?
Bart Simpson: Who the hell is that?
Homer Simpson: Bullwinkle.
Bart Simpson: Who? (BEAT) Wait a minute, who's that?
Homer Simpson: Underdog! Don't you know anything?
Bart Simpson: Well, I know it wouldn't hurt 'em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years.
Homer Simpson: Son, this is a tradition. If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce.
Lisa Simpson: Maggie, I'm about to unveil my centerpiece to the family!
Selma Bouvier: Here comes the cavalry!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Marge Simpson: Homer, you promised to be nice to my sisters.

Maggie Simpson: (SUCKS PACIFIER)
Lisa Simpson: As one of the Simpson women, would you like to contribute something to it?
Lisa Simpson: (HUGS MAGGIE) Oh, thank you.
Marge Simpson: Honey, please. You're in the way.
Bart Simpson: Can't I help you, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Well, okay. Let's see... Can you do the cranberry sauce?
Bart Simpson: Yeah! Where is it?
Marge Simpson: The can is in the cupboard on the bottom shelf.
Bart Simpson: Here?
Marge Simpson: (DIRECTING HIM) No, no, no, the other shelf.
Bart Simpson: Got it. Now what?
Marge Simpson: Open the can.
Bart Simpson: No problemo. Where's the can opener?
Marge Simpson: It's in the second drawer from the right.
Marge Simpson: No, no, no, no, the other one.

Marge Simpson: Just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done. Bart. Bart?

Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR; DEADLY TONE) You knew that I was cooking a turkey.
Patty Bouvier: Which is fine!
Selma Bouvier: More power to ya!
Patty Bouvier: It's just that some people find your turkey a little dry.
Selma Bouvier: Mmm-hmm, and if they want an option... they'll have it.

Announcer: (FROM TV) And the Silverdome, now ablaze with flashbulbs, as "Hurray for Everything" leaves the field! Of course, a stadium's much too big for flash pictures to work, but nobody seems to care!

Jacqueline Bouvier: (WHISPERING) Leave me alone.
Selma Bouvier: How long did that take you, honey?
Lisa Simpson: I couldn't tell you how many hours. It was a labor of love. It's my homage to some American heroes who may not have fought in any wars, but who nevertheless...
Bart Simpson: Da da daah da da dah daaahhh...
Homer Simpson: Speaking of heroes, here's mine... Tom Turkey!
Bart Simpson: Yikes! What is that?

Marge Simpson: Yes, you do! I hope you're happy, Bart! You've RUINED THANKSGIVING!
Bart Simpson: (FUMING) I didn't ruin Thanksgiving! She did... Buncha jerks... I always get blamed for everything...
Homer Simpson: ...And, Lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. You saw what happened. Oh, Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?

Bart Simpson: Why should I?
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern - continuous)
Barney Gumble: But I only got up to go to the can.
Homer Simpson: Damn, no spots.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, the only reason to apologize is if you look deep down inside yourself and you find a spot, something you wish wasn't there, because you feel bad you hurt your sister's feelings.
Bart Simpson: Leave me alone!
Lisa Simpson: (STRIDENT) Just look!
Bart Simpson: Okay... okay.
Bart Simpson: Hmmm, hmmm. Looking for the spot... Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm... Still checking. This is so stupid... I'm not gonna find anything... Just because I wrecked something she worked really hard on and I made her cr... Uh-oh!

(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern - day)
Homer Simpson: Rasputin's got the reach, but on the other hand, the Professor's got his patented coma lock. If you ask me, this is gonna be one hell of a match.

MURDOCK: (CHUCKLES) I almost forgot. To add a real element of danger, one drop of human blood.
MURDOCK: On the chance that I don't survive, let me just say, seat belts save lives so buckle up.

(HOSPITAL WARD: Int. hospital ward - day)

Marge Simpson: Gee, I never realized TV was such a dangerous influence.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, as tragic as all this is, it's a small price to pay for countless hours of top-notch entertainment.

(Springfield Gorge: Ext. Springfield GORGE - continuous)
SMYTHE: Hello, children, and welcome to Springfield Gorge.

MURDOCK: Ow! Doc, I heard a snap.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hmm. I'm afraid the bone's broken. Well, that's all of them.
MURDOCK: Don't worry, partner. I've broken that thumb dozens of times. Hey, I bet you'd like an autograph. Nurse.
MURDOCK: (WITH PEN IN MOUTH) Who should I make this out to?
Bart Simpson: Just Bart will be fine, sir.

MURDOCK: (TO NURSE AND DOCTOR) Could you leave me with the young'uns, please?
Bart Simpson: What's the matter?
Homer Simpson: You didn't mean that. Bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises I don't expect you to keep. If you make this promise, you have to keep it.
Bart Simpson: Why?
(SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY: ext. side of the highway)
MURDOCK: Now let me start by saying... good for you, son. It's always good to see young people taking an interest in danger. Now, a lot of people are gonna be telling you you're crazy, and maybe they're right. But the fact of the matter is: bones heal, chicks dig scars, and the United States of America has the best doctor to daredevil ratio in the world.
Lisa Simpson: But Captain Murdock!
Bart Simpson: Thanks, Lance.
MURDOCK: You're welcome, little pardner. On your way out, tell the nurse I'm ready for my sponge bath. (WINKS AT BART) Another fringe benefit. Nurse.

Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry, Bart. But if you got hurt or died, despite the extra attention I'd receive, I'd miss you.
Bart Simpson: Bart, I forbid you to jump over that gorge.
Bart Simpson: You can't.
Homer Simpson: I can and do. Go to your room, Bart! There, I've done it. I'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all.
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but there's no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and headin' for that gorge.
Homer Simpson: He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you're his father. You've got to try and reason with him.
Homer Simpson: Oh, that never works. He's a goner.
Marge Simpson: (EXASPERATED) Oh, come on, Homer. A heart to heart talk with your son, you've got to try.

Homer Simpson: BART!
Bart Simpson: Hey, what gives?
Homer Simpson: Boy, I've tried ordering you, I've tried punishing you, and God help me, I even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself.
Bart Simpson: What? Why?
Homer Simpson: Because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.
Bart Simpson: (WORRIED) But, Dad, you'll never make it.
Homer Simpson: Don't you think I know that?
Homer Simpson: Goodbye, son.
Bart Simpson: Wait, dad. Don't do it. I won't jump anymore, I promise.

Marge Simpson: What do we want?
Marge Simpson: HER GROUP
Marge Simpson: (CHANTING) Substantially-less
Marge Simpson: violence-in children's-program-ming.
Marge Simpson: KRUSTY
Marge Simpson: (OVER CHANTING) No! You're ruining the show. Oh... Oh... Oh. Stop.
Marge Simpson: Please stop. Please. Be quiet.
Marge Simpson: Oh, please. All right. I'm trying to earn a living here. All right! Stop! Stop!
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (GRUFFLY) That woman. That screwball, Marge Simpson. We've got to stop her. But how?
Animator: (QUICKLY) Drop an anvil on her?
1ST BOARD MEMBER: Hit her on the head with a piano?
2nd Board Member: Stuff her full of TNT, then throw a match down her throat and run?
Roger Meyers, Jr.: All your fancy degrees and that's the best you can do? You make me sick.
(I & S INTERNATIONAL: ext. I & s international - FRONT GATE)
Animator: Hmmm. Ah ha! I'm so funny.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson HOUSE - living room - a week later)
Homer Simpson: You know, some of these stories are pretty good. I never know mice lived such interesting lives.
Marge Simpson: So much needless brutality. I don't know if I'm having any impact at all.
Squirrel: (MARGE-LIKE VOICE) Don't do that! Don't do that! Hey! Don't DO that!
Homer Simpson: (LAUGHING) Take that you dumb squirrel.
Marge Simpson: (SEETHING) Mmmmmmmph!
Homer Simpson: (LAUGHING) Where do they get their ideas?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE, TESTY) What is it? What? "Smartline?" Yes, I've heard of your late-night panel discussion show. (LISTENS, STILL ANGRY) Well, I'd love to.
Announcer #2: "Smartline!" With our local Emmy-award winning, host... Kent Brockman.
Lisa Simpson: (POINTING) There she is!
(TV Studio: int. tv studio - set of "smartline")
Roger Meyers, Jr.: Thank you.
Krusty the Clown: Hi, Kent! (KRUSTY LAUGH)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Hiya.
Bart Simpson: Me and the guys went fishing. Almost caught a catfish this big. (STRETCHES ARMS WIDE)
Roger Meyers, Jr.: There's nothing wrong with it.
Marge Simpson: (UNCOMFORTABLE, EYEING CAMERA) Excuse me. Excuse me. He was addressing me.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: I know. There's nothing wrong with it.
Marge Simpson: Excuse me. There is! I think that it's a bad influence on children.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: Oh, give me a break! I think that is a bunch of baloney. And here's why. In preparing for this debate, I did a little research and I discovered a startling thing. There was violence in the past, long before cartoons were invented.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: Yeah, and there was something called the Crusades, for instance. Tremendous violence! Many people killed! The darn thing went on for thirty years.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: That's right, Kent. (TO MARGE) So much for your viewpoint.
Marge Simpson: (SNORTS)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Ah, well, Kent... to me, the high jinks - of a few comic characters absolutely pale in comparison with the crippling emotional problems a psychiatrist runs into every day. I'm… I'm referring here to women who love too much, fear of winning, sexaholism... stuff like that.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, not at all. In fact, one of my guilty little pleasures is to snuggle up with a big bucket of buttered popcorn, dim the lights, turn on Itchy & Scratchy, and laugh myself silly. And what the hell is wrong with that?
Krusty the Clown: (KRUSTY LAUGH) Hi kids!!! (KRUSTY LAUGHS AGAIN)
Krusty the Clown: (APOLOGETICALLY) Oh. I'm sorry, Kent. It's just that when the camera gets on me... (NOTICES CAMERA)... HEY HEY!!! (KRUSTY LAUGH)
Krusty the Clown: Oh.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh.
Marge Simpson: Yes. I'd like to ask all the parents in Springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel. Thank you.
(I & S INTERNATIONAL: int. I & s international - board room - NEXT DAY)
Roger Meyers, Jr.: I don't believe this... "I will never watch your show, buy any of your products... or brake if I see you crossing the street." Wow, that's cold.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: "Dear Sleaze Merchant" -- Now, come on, that hurts.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: Gentlemen, the screwballs have spoken.

Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) Is this Marge Simpson?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: The Marge Simpson who fixed it so cartoons can't be violent anymore?
Marge Simpson: (THROUGH PHONE) Yes?
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) This is Myers. I'm here with the writers. Listen, you're so smart, how do we end this picture?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Well... what's the problem you're having?
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) Okay, here it is. Itchy just stole Scratchy's ice cream cone...
Animator: (INTERRUPTING) Make it a pie. Pies are easier to draw.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) Okay, a pie. Anyway, Scratchy is understandably upset.
Marge Simpson: Huh huh.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: So we figured he could - you know - just grab Itchy and toss him in a bucket of acid.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh dear!
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) But then we remembered that this might be interpreted as violence which is morally wrong now, thanks to you. So what's your big idea? How do we end this?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Well... let's see... Oh! couldn't Itchy share his pie with Scratchy? Then they would both have pie.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (THOUGHTFULLY LOOKING AT THE STORYBOARD) It's different, I'll give you that.

Bart Simpson: Borrowed?
Announcer: It's an asphalt spreader! It's sixty- seven tools in one! How much would you pay for a machine that can do all this?
Homer Simpson: One thousand dollars.
Announcer: Don't answer yet...
Homer Simpson: Oh, sorry.
Announcer: ... because you also get...
Homer Simpson: (MILD PROTEST) I was watching that.

Scratchy: Lemonade?
Itchy: Please!
Scratchy: I made it just for you.
Itchy: You are my best friend.
Lisa Simpson: Itchy and Scratchy seem to have lost their edge.
Marge Simpson: I think it conveys a very nice message of sharing.
Bart Simpson: I think it sucks.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAM) ... Oh, hey, thank you, Maggie.
Itchy: Mmmm, this really hits the spot.
Scratchy: Doesn't it though?
Itchy: You really make good lemonade, Scratchy.
Scratchy: Oh, oh, oh. Thank you, Itchy.
Krusty the Clown: Wasn't that funny, boys and girls? (FRUSTRATED) (A LITTLE TOUGH) Well? Wasn't it?
Marge Simpson: Aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?

Homer Simpson: Sit down, boy!
Lisa Simpson: And Janey and I went bird watching. We saw a grackle.
Marge Simpson: That's nice dear.
Bart Simpson: Come on, Lis. Let's go finish our soapbox racers.
Lisa Simpson: Okay. May we please be excused?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Homer Simpson: (AWE) Wow. What great kids. This is the golden age, Marge. And the parents of Springfield owe it all to you.

Marge Simpson: (SLEEPILY) What in the world?
Helen Lovejoy: Get dressed, Marge. You've got to lead our protest against this abomination!
Marge Simpson: (MYSTIFIED) Hmmm, but that's Michelangelo's David. It's a masterpiece!
Helen Lovejoy: (CORRECTING HER) It's filth. It graphically portrays parts of the human body which - practical as they may be... are evil!
Marge Simpson: But I like that statue.
Helen Lovejoy: (GASPS)
Maude Flanders: I told you she was soft on full frontal nudity. Come on, girls.

Homer Simpson: Really? Great!
Marge Simpson: I'm not. I think everyone in Springfield should see it.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) Hmmm... yes and no.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Hold it, hold it, hold it... how can you be for one form of freedom of expression, like (INDICATES STATUE) our big naked friend over there, and be against another form, like Itchy and Scratchy?
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Kent Brockman: Good question.
Marge Simpson: (THINKS) Well... I guess I can't, which is a shame because I really hate those cartoons.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Oh yeah, well what do you have to say to all those Marge Simpson wannabes out there who wish to suppress David's doodle.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) Um, I don't know. I guess one person can make a difference, but most of the time, they probably shouldn't.
Kent Brockman: Well... I guess that settles that. I'd like to alert our affiliates that we will be ending our show early tonight. Join us tomorrow when our topic will be, "Religion: Which is the One True Faith?"

Homer Simpson: Oh. What's wrong, Marge?
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homie. Here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other.
Homer Simpson: Hey, don't worry Marge, pretty soon every boy and girl in Springfield Elementary School is gonna come and see this thing.
Marge Simpson: Really, why?

Bart Simpson: Hey, I'm innocent, man!
Devil: (CHUCKLING) Innocent. Everybody's innocent. Okay, let's just pull up your file here.
Devil: Okay... Hmmm. Seems to be a mistake. According to this, you're not due to arrive here until the next time the Yankees win the pennant, that's nearly a century from now. Ha, ha. Boy is my face red.

Bart Simpson: (A LITTLE TROUBLED) Um... say... is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here?

Lionel Hutz: It turns into a sponge when you put it in water.
Homer Simpson: Ooo, classy.
Lionel Hutz: I'd like to talk to you about bringing legal action against the fiend who did this to your boy.
Scratchy: (EVEN MORE AGONIZED SHRIEK)
Homer Simpson: Well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. And besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. Nothing serious.
Lionel Hutz: (SCOFFING) Doctors! Doctors are idiots! There's no telling what kind of permanent injuries he might have. You might have to wait on him hand and foot (POKING HOMER IN THE CHEST AT EACH WORD) for the rest of his natural life!
Lionel Hutz: That's the downside. Now here's the good part. You can ching-ching-ching cash in on this tragedy.
Homer Simpson: (MASSAGING HIS CHEST) Wow...
Lisa Simpson: Excuse me, Mr. Hutz. Are you a shyster?
Lionel Hutz: How does a nice little girl like you know a big word like that?
Marge Simpson: Mr. Hutz, this is hardly the time or place to discuss this.
Lionel Hutz: You're right, you're right. When you feel up to it, come over to my office and we'll talk about it.
Lionel Hutz: (FADING) Lionel Hutz, Attorney-At-Law. What's that, a broken neck? Great!
Lisa Simpson: Hello, Dr. Hibbert.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hello, Lisa. (TO BART) Well, we've got a nasty bump on our head, haven't we?
Bart Simpson: Ow! Quit it!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: And a little tiny broken toe. (WRIGGLES BART'S BROKEN TOE)
Bart Simpson: Ow! Quit it!

Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hmm. Better let him rest up awhile first.

Homer Simpson: W-well... It's a v-very generous offer, sir. But... his medical bills alone...
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, so extortion is the name of your little game, is it Simpson? (GRABBING CHECK) Very well. Then you get nothing. I have the finest lawyers in Springfield, Simpson. (THE LAWYERS NOD SMUGLY) Tangle with me and I'll crush you like a paper cup.

Homer Simpson: (RESISTING) Fifty percent?
Lionel Hutz: You'll be getting more than just a lawyer, Mr. Simpson. You'll also be getting this exquisite faux pearl necklace -- a $99 value -- as our gift to you.

Homer Simpson: (BREAKING DOWN AGAIN) No!
Bart Simpson: But I played baseball this morning!
Marge Simpson: That's right, he did. Excuse me, but Dr. Hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought Bart was fine.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Dr. Hibbert from (SING-SONG) Johns Hopkins Medical School?
Lionel Hutz: With all due respect, Mrs. Simpson, you are not a doctor, the boy's not a doctor, I'm not a doctor. The only person in this room who even comes close is this man.

Bart Simpson: (INTIMIDATED) I am in constant pain.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, may I please make an observation?
Homer Simpson: Oh, what? What is it?
Lisa Simpson: I think this is all a charade to make Bart look more injured than he really is.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe Lisa does have a point. I don't mind you boys doing this in the living room, but in court doesn't Bart have to tell the truth?
Lionel Hutz: Yeah, but what is truth -- if you follow me. Now, Bart, can you roll your eyes back in your head like this?

Marge Simpson: What do you think, Homer?
Homer Simpson: I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks (SCREAMING) I'm an idiot. The only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.

Blue-Haired Lawyer: (FEIGNED SURPRISE) But, wait a minute! I'm confused! This court heard "expert" testimony from one Dr. Nick Riviera. What is your opinion of him?
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS UNCOMFORTABLY)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Mrs. Simpson...
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, but my mother always said, "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."
Homer Simpson: (TO HUTZ) Will that hold up in court?
Lionel Hutz: No, I've tried it before.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: (FORCEFULLY) Mrs. Simpson, what is your opinion of Dr. Riviera? And let me remind you that you're under oath.
Marge Simpson: Well, to be honest, he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping Bart in bandages than in making him feel better. And he mispronounced words that even I know, like abdomen. And his office was dirty. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure he's even a doctor.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: And Mrs. Simpson, could you describe for us in your own words Bart's (MAKES AIR QUOTES WITH FINGERS) "intense mental anguish and suffering"?
Marge Simpson: Well, I don't know how intense it was...
BURNS LAWYER: Huh uh.
Marge Simpson: ...but, well, I guess he did miss three days of school --
BURNS LAWYER: Oh, three days.
Marge Simpson: ...although he doesn't really like school all that much,
Marge Simpson: ...so I guess that may not count as anguish.
BURNS LAWYER: No, it doesn't.
Marge Simpson: It was a little hard on me having him around the house
BURNS LAWYER: Yes...
Marge Simpson: ...all that time.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships?
Marge Simpson: Well, we pay Bart five dollars a week to take out the trash...
BURNS LAWYER: Huh uh.
Marge Simpson: I suppose if he'd been able to do it that week, we might have given him the five dollars.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Five dollars?
Marge Simpson: Um-hmm.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: But your lawyer -- assuming he is a lawyer -- is asking for a million? (TO JURY) Well, we can't blame them for trying can we. Thank you very much, Mrs. Simpson.
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING) Oh, Marge.
(GLASS BOOTH: INT. GLASS BOOTH)
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm going to write a figure on this piece of paper. It's not quite as large as the last one, but I think you'll find it fair.
Lionel Hutz: I think we should take it.
Homer Simpson: (SHUDDERS)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - dining room)
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars.
Marge Simpson: Homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) Yeah, a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman. (FLATLY) No, thank you.
Marge Simpson: Some string beans?
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) No I don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. Uh oh I better answer. (FLATLY) No, thank you.
Marge Simpson: Some celery with cream cheese on it?
Homer Simpson: (UNINTELLIGIBLE MURMUR) (FLATLY) No, thank you.
Bart Simpson: You know what would've really been cool? If we got that million bucks.
Marge Simpson: Bart, please.
Bart Simpson: What? We could have bought tons of great stuff, Mom... maids, a pool, fancy sweaters... stop me if I'm wrong.
Homer Simpson: Marge, dear. Would it be all right if I went over to Moe's for a drink?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) I don't know if I'll ever come back here. (FLATLY) Goodnight.
Marge Simpson: (SHRIEK)
Marge Simpson: (THINKING) My woman's intuition is telling me something... I wonder what... Oh my god.
(Moe's Tavern: INT. MOE'S TAVERN)
Homer Simpson: Well, that's it. I guess this is the class I'm gonna die in.
Moe Szyslak: Eh, you're better off. Rich people aren't happy. From the day they're born, to the day they die, they think they're happy but, trust me... they ain't.
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) Moe, I wish he'd shut up.
Larry: Look, a chick!
Moe Szyslak: And it's not even Ladies Night.
Homer Simpson: Hey, hey, guys. Knock it off. It's just my wife.
Marge Simpson: (WITH THE ABOVE) My name is Marge. (TO HOMER)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Marge...
Marge Simpson: We've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- I mean, I know this is different than that time I washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but I--
Homer Simpson: (WITH TROUBLE) No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance.
Marge Simpson: What are you saying, Homer?
Homer Simpson: I'm saying... (THINKING) She's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. (TO MARGE) I'm not sure I love you anymore.
Marge Simpson: (GASPS)
Homer Simpson: But don't worry. I'll never let on. I'll still do all the bed stuff. Maybe it won't be so bad.
Marge Simpson: Oh my Lord. Well, I don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
Marge Simpson: Homer, look at me.
Homer Simpson: Alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her.
Homer Simpson: Oh, who am I kidding? I love you more than ever.
Marge Simpson: I love you too!
Senator Mendoza: McBain!!
Homer Simpson: Sorry to scare you like that, babe.
Moe Szyslak: Okay, everybody! For the next fifteen minutes, one third off on every pitcher... one per customer... domestic beer only... hey, no sharing!
(Simpson Kitchen: INT. SIMPSON KITCHEN - DINNERTIME)
Homer Simpson: Is it done yet? Is it done yet?
Marge Simpson: Your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? (COUNTING DOWN WITH TIMER) Four, three, two, one, ping!
Homer Simpson: We have meatloaf!
Marge Simpson: (CALLS OUT) Get it while it's unbelievably hot, kids!
Homer Simpson: (TEMPTINGLY) Yum. I've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) Thursday -- meatloaf night. As it was, is now, and ever shall be.
Homer Simpson: What are you getting at?
Lisa Simpson: Well, you're always trying to teach me to be opened-minded, try new things, live life to the...
Homer Simpson: What are you talking about? Nobody's trying to teach you that.
Homer Simpson: Shut up, boy.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe Lisa's right. Tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner.
Homer Simpson: Tomorrow night!? Friday!? Pork chop night!? Marge, we haven't missed pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) Friday night, pork chops. From cradle to grave... etched in stone in God's library somewhere...
Homer Simpson: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Where do you want to go?
Lisa Simpson: Anywhere but hamburgers, pizza or fried chicken.
Homer Simpson: Fine. We'll go to Mars.
Marge Simpson: There's that new sushi restaurant on Elm Street.
Bart Simpson: Sushi? Hey, maybe this is just one of those things you hear on the playground... but, isn't that raw fish?
Lisa Simpson: As usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point entirely. Sushi is considered quite a delicacy.
Marge Simpson: Please, Homer. Can't we try it?
Homer Simpson: No!
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad. This argument humiliates us both.
Homer Simpson: If I said no the first time, what makes you think I'm gonna say yes the second time?
Lisa Simpson: Nothing, but you might say yes the ninety-ninth time.
Homer Simpson: Oh, try me.
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad.
Homer Simpson: No!

Marge Simpson: What would you recommend for a family that's not sure they should be here?
Akira: The sushi sampler has a little bit of everything. It is very non-threatening.
Marge Simpson: I'll have one of those.
Lisa Simpson: Make it two.
Bart Simpson: Akira, my good man, I'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel.
Akira: Very good.
Bart Simpson: (TO AKIRA) Do you have any giant squid? The kind that drags men to their deaths?
Akira: Not today. (TO HOMER) And sir?
Homer Simpson: It's so hard to choose. It all looks so terrible. Just bring me (POINTING AT MENU) one of these, and one of these, and one of those.
(The Happy Sumo: Int. the happy sumo - kitchen)
Toshiro: What do you think, Master?
Master: No, no, no. Toshiro, the squid looks like it's been hacked by a blind woodsman. Hang your head in shame.
Homer Simpson: Good thing I'm open-minded. (PINCHES HIS NOSE)
Homer Simpson: Hmmm. Hmmm. Not bad. Interesting.
Homer Simpson: I'll try this little pink one, here. Hmmm, very good. Another one.

Homer Simpson: ... oh, oh, and two of these things.
Akira: Two uni.
Homer Simpson: And, Oh, Oh, I don't believe I've tried the flying fish roe...
Akira: I recommend it with a raw quail egg on top.
Homer Simpson: You're the doctor!
Bart Simpson: (SINGING IN LOW VOICE) "WHO'S THE BLACK PRIVATE DICK THAT'S THE SEX MACHINE TO ALL THE CHICKS?"

Bart Simpson: "You're damn right. WHO'S THE CAT THAT WON'T COP OUT / WHEN THERE'S DANGER ALL ABOUT?"
Lisa Simpson: "Shaft."
Bart Simpson: "Right on."
Homer Simpson: There's gotta be something I haven't tried. Huh? Hey! What's this? Fugu!
Akira: It is blowfish, sir. But I should warn you that one...
Homer Simpson: Come on, pal! Fugu me!
Bart Simpson: "THEY SAY THIS CAT SHAFT IS A BAD MOTHER..."
Lisa Simpson: "Shut your mouth!"
Bart Simpson: "But I'm talkin' about Shaft."
Lisa Simpson: "I can dig it!"
Bart Simpson: "HE'S A COMPLICATED MAN BUT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HIM BUT HIS WOMAN."
Lisa Simpson: "John Shaft."
Master: Oh, she's here. Cover for me.
Akira: One fugu.
Toshiro: Not fugu! If it is cut improperly it's... it's...
Akira: (DISMISSING) Yes, yes, it is poisonous, potentially fatal, but if sliced properly, it can be quite tasty.
Toshiro: (TO HIMSELF) I must get the Master.
Master: Oh, Miss Krabappel, your hair smells so clean.
Toshiro: Master, you are needed in the kitchen.
Master: I said cover for me, damn it!
Toshiro: But Master, we need your skilled hands.
Master: My skilled hands are busy. You do it!
Toshiro: Poison, poison, tasty fish.
Toshiro: (TO HIMSELF) Concentrate. Concentrate...
Homer Simpson: (YELLING) I want fugu!
Homer Simpson: Mmmm. Fan-fugu-tastic.
Homer Simpson: Beautiful language, isn't it, Marge?
Toshiro: For God's sake, don't eat another bite!
Homer Simpson: Oh, I couldn't possibly.
Toshiro: Mr. Simpson-san. I shall be blunt. We have reason to believe you have eaten poison.
Homer Simpson: Poison! What should I do? What should I do? Tell me quick!
Toshiro: Oh, no need to panic. There's a map to the hospital on the back of the menu.
(Hospital: ext. hospital - establishing)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF, MIMICKING) "Try something new, Homer. What'll it hurt you, Homer?" (THEN) I never heard of a poison pork chop.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hmmm, your wife agreed that I should break this to you.
Homer Simpson: No need, Doc. I can read Marge like a book.
Homer Simpson: (BRIGHTLY) Oooh! It's good news, isn't it?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: No, Mr. Simpson. If in fact, you've consumed the venom of the blowfish -- and from what the chef has told me, it's quite probable, you have twenty-four hours to live.
Homer Simpson: (UPSET) Twenty-four hours?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, twenty-two. I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Homer Simpson: (BREAKING DOWN) Oh Marge, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, if there's one consolation it's that you will feel no pain at all until some time tomorrow evening when your heart suddenly explodes.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Now, a little death anxiety is normal. You can expect to go through five stages. The first is denial.
Homer Simpson: No way! Because I'm not dying.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: The second is anger.
Homer Simpson: (GROWING ANGRY) Why you little --
Dr. Julius Hibbert: And after that comes fear.
Homer Simpson: (FEARFULLY) What's after fear? What's after fear?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Bargaining.
Homer Simpson: Doc, you gotta get me out of this. I'll make it worth your while.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Finally, acceptance.
Homer Simpson: Well, we all gotta go some time.
Homer Simpson: Told ya. Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave.

Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, Homer. Have you thought about what you want to tell the kids?
Homer Simpson: Nothing. It'll just upset them. I want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS IN AGREEMENT) Well, have you decided what you want to do tomorrow?
Homer Simpson: Almost.
Homer Simpson: I'm not done yet, Marge. What's that word you use for when you and I... you know...
Marge Simpson: When we're intimate?
Homer Simpson: (WRITING) Be intimate with Marge.

Bart Simpson: (RAPID FIRE PROTEST) Oh, come on, I do plenty around here! Lisa never lifts a finger. Why don't you go yell at her?
Homer Simpson: Shut up! Bart, this is good stuff. I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one, "cover for me." Number two, "oh, good idea, boss." Number three, "it was like that when I got here."
Bart Simpson: Hey, this is good stuff.
Homer Simpson: ...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.

Announcer #2: Yeah, it is far from over, but uh his approach has been wrong from the beginning as far as I'm concerned.
Announcer: Well, he's an erratic bowler, Chad. He tends to explode in the seven eight nine frame... Though I remember... in Boline, Illinois.
Announcer #2: Actually that, actually that was Pontiac, Michigan.
Announcer: Oh, thirty-eight pins going into the...
Announcer #2: Well he's stepping up now and he needs to get at least a spare...

Bart Simpson: Oh, it will not.
Homer Simpson: Oh yes it will.
Bald One: Our next movie is "McBane." Another shoot 'em up, push 'em through the plate-glass window, splatter-fest from the Hollywood cookie-cutter. Here's a typically brainless scene.
(Police Captain's Office: int. police captain's office)

Fat One: You know, I can't believe we're talking about the same movie!
Bald One: Oh, no...
Fat One: I thought "McBane" was a non-stop, roller-coaster of chills, thrills, spills and kills.
Bald One: (GROAN)
Fat One: And that chase at the end my friend... (KISSING NOISE)
Bald One: Are you nuts? That movie stinks like a creepy one bedroom apartment.
Fat One: Your mother didn't think it was so creepy.
Bald One: My mother. Real mature. I'm sick of your...
Homer Simpson: I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
Bart Simpson: Hey, what gives?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, do something!
Homer Simpson: All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery.
Bart Simpson: Looks like you lost the patient, Doc.
Homer Simpson: Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?
Lisa Simpson: (ALARMED) No!
Homer Simpson: How's this?
Lisa Simpson: (SCREAM)
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY) Okay, just everybody remain calm.
Lisa Simpson: (ANGUISHED SCREAM)
Bart Simpson: Hey, everybody! If you look real close, you can kinda make 'em out.
Homer Simpson: Hey, yeah, yeah. I think I can.
Marge Simpson: I think this is sick. They're staring at a dot!
Homer Simpson: She's right! She's right!
Homer Simpson: (BREAKS DOWN, CRYING) Oh, how I miss TV! Dear, God. Just give me one channel!
Marge Simpson: Homer. It's not the end of the world. You know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television.
Bart Simpson: You lie!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: No, it's true, Bart. We used to shoot pool... and go dancing...
Lisa Simpson: How romantic.
Marge Simpson: And a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk, just like this.
Marge Simpson: Whoa--
Bart Simpson: I'm livin' it but I ain't lovin' it.
Lisa Simpson: It's so hard to picture you two then. Hand in hand at the crossroads of life. There are so many questions.

Marge Simpson: I'm for equal rights. But do we really need a whole amendment?
Kim: Come on, Marge. Don't you think you deserve to earn just as much as a man who does the same job?

Principal Dondelinger: Allow me, gentlemen. You just bought yourselves three days of detention. You know where and when.
Barney Gumble: (SADLY) Three o'clock. Old building. Room 106.
(Springfield High School: ext. springfield high school - front lawn)
Marge Simpson: ... And in another article, I found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife, who incidentally is not married to a house, would cost forty-eight thousand dollars a year!
Marge Simpson: The first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these... male imposed shackles.
Kim: I didn't think it would burn so fast.
Marge Simpson: Hm, I guess it's the tissue paper inside.
Principal Dondelinger: Miss Bouvier, I am surprised!

MCINTYRE: (CHUCKLES) That's not exactly the type of guidance I give.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Oh.
MCINTYRE: Well, I like to think I do something helpful for every student N through Z. The only advice I can give you is, try to share a common interest and spend, spend, spend.

Marge Simpson: (READING) "Myth: It's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies. Fact: Most movies shown on cable get two stars or less and are repeated ad nauseam." Hmm, well, I don't know.
Homer Simpson: Marge --
Homer Simpson: "Hear Me Roar -- The Network For Women."
Woman #1: (FROM TV) In the next half hour we'll show you how to cut your first aid bill in half by making your own bandaids.
Marge Simpson: Ooh. That's a good idea.
Woman #2: Now before we begin you'll need five yards of sterilized cotton...
Mexican Announcer: (THRU TV) El Mummeo le pone en el "Sleeper Hold". Donde esta los medicos de Mexico?
Homer Simpson: Oooo. Pro wrestling from Mexico. You know, down there it's a real sport.
Bart Simpson: Cool. This is where Jaws eats the boat.
Bart Simpson: Cool. This is where Die Hard jumps through the window.
Bart Simpson: Cool. This is where Wall Street gets arrested. (LAUGH)
Representative: (THRU TV; MATTER-OF-FACT) Mr. Speaker, if I could call your attention to the Retroactive Subsidy Appropriations Override Bill. I refer you to page four thousand five hundred and...
Homer Simpson: They must think people will watch anything.

Goliath: I don't know, Davey.
Marge Simpson: Aren't you ready for church, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Huh, wha'? Oh, okay.
(First Church of Springfield: int. church - day)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now today's Christian doesn't think he needs God. He thinks he's got it made. He's got his hi-fi... his boob tube... and his instant pizza pie...
Homer Simpson: (LICKING HIS CHOPS) Oooh. Pizza.
(Sunday School: int. sunday school - classroom - later)
Teacher: All right, children. Now, I don't want you to get frightened, but it's my responsibility to teach you this. Today's topic will be "hell".
Bart Simpson: All right. I've sat through mercy and I've sat through forgiveness. Finally, we get to the good stuff.
Teacher: Oh hell is a terrible place. Maggots are your sheet, worms your blanket. There's a lake of fire burning with sulfur, you'll be tormented day and night forever and ever. As a matter of fact, if you actually saw Hell, you'd be so frightened, you would die.
Bart Simpson: Oh, Miss Albright.
Teacher: Yes, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Are there pirates in hell?
Martin Prince: (RAISING HAND) So what you're saying is, there's a down side to the afterlife. How does one steer clear of this abode of the damned?
Teacher: By obeying the Ten Commandments.
Teacher: Ten simple rules that are easy to live by.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car)
Marge Simpson: So, what did you children learn about today?
Bart Simpson: Hell.
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Well, that's what we learned about. I sure as hell can't tell you we learned about hell unless I say hell, can I?
Homer Simpson: The lad has a point.
Bart Simpson: Hell, yes.
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: (SING-SONGY) Hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell.
Marge Simpson: Bart, you're no longer in Sunday School. Don't swear.

Lisa Simpson: (THUNDEROUSLY) Thou shalt not steal!
Clerk: Anything else?
Marge Simpson: Yes. I ate two grapes. Please charge me for them.
Clerk: Oh, two grapes? Who cares?
Marge Simpson: Just charge me something, please.
Clerk: Yeah, okay, all right. (INTO MIC) I need a price check on two grapes. Yeah, you heard me, Phil, two measly, stinking grapes.

Blockbuster Announcer: If you didn't catch it in the theater, or rent it, or see it someplace else, we've got it -- on the Blockbuster Channel!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Oh, great... (TO LISA) All right, what makes you say that?
Lisa Simpson: Well, at Sunday School we learned that stealing is a sin.
Homer Simpson: Well, duh.
Lisa Simpson: But everybody does it! I mean, we're stealing cable as we speak.
Homer Simpson: Oh. Hm, look at it this way. When you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?
Lisa Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: And did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?
Lisa Simpson: No, I didn't.
Homer Simpson: Well, run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the Feds.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I think that's pretty spurious.
Homer Simpson: Well, thank you honey.
Blockbuster Announcer: Friday night, live from Las Vegas. The ultimate match-up. The Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out.

Lenny Leonard: Hey, big fight comin' up.
Carl Carlson: Yeah, you want to come over to my house and listen to round-by-round updates on the radio?
Lenny Leonard: Oh yeah, okay. Oh, then after the fight, we can watch the still photos on the eleven o'clock news.
Carl Carlson: Not too shabby! Whadda you say, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (COYLY) We could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable TV.
Homer Simpson: Pass the pumice, please.
Waylon Smithers: Uh, he's Homer Simpson, sir. One of your drones from sector 7G.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. I'm so keen on seeing Watson vs. Tatum II, I'd even go to an employee's house. Oh, I can picture it now. The screen door rusting off its filthy hinges. Mangy dog staggering about looking vainly for a place to die.
Waylon Smithers: Permission to speak frankly, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Permission granted.
Waylon Smithers: Well, you are quite wealthy sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Thank you, Smithers. Your candor is most refreshing.
Waylon Smithers: No, no, I mean, why don't you pay for the fight yourself?
C. Montgomery Burns: Eh, Smithers, a big title fight is one of those rare occasions that I savor the sights, the sounds; and, (INHALES DEEPLY) ah yes, the smells of other men.
Waylon Smithers: You haven't lost the common touch, sir.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's bar - later that day)
Barney Gumble: So, Homer, I hear you got the fight.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, that's right. Eight o'clock, my place. Come one, come all.
Barney Gumble: Hey, Moe, how come you never got cable for the bar?
Moe Szyslak: Well, it was either cable or the mechanical bull.
Moe Szyslak: I made my choice and I stand by it.

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Thank you, but this store is open twenty-four hours. It puts great demands on my time.
Homer Simpson: Oh, too bad. It's gonna be a great fight.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh, the fight. Why didn't you say something? I'll get my brother, Sanjay, to cover for me. He deplores violence of all kinds.
(First Church of Springfield: ext. church - establishing)
Lisa Simpson: So, even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family, that would be stealing?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: No. Well, it is if he puts anything on it. Jelly, for example.
Lisa Simpson: (SOLEMNLY) I see.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (BEAT) Come on, Lisa, now you're here for a reason. (QUIETLY) Is your father stealing bread?
Lisa Simpson: Maybe. I don't watch him every minute. But what I am sure of is, we're getting cable for free.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, I'm afraid that is stealing, Lisa, and I think you must do something... hmmm.
Lisa Simpson: Should I have my father arrested?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, Lisa, on the surface, that would appear to be an ideal solution to the problem. But remember the Fourth Commandment, "Honor thy father and thy mother." Hmmm, Lisa, I would like to see you set an example by not watching the offending technology yourself?
Lisa Simpson: Thank you, Reverend Lovejoy.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - day)
Top Hat Announcer: (BREATHLESS FEMALE VOICE) You're watching Top Hat Entertainment. Adult programming all day, every day, except in Florida and Utah. Coming up next, "Stardust Memories."
Bart Simpson: (WIDE-EYED) Aye Carumba!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Dad!
Bart Simpson: Oh, here's what I was looking for.
Stock Reporter: Blue chips closed up three and three quarters... Oil service stocks slumped slightly on news of OPEC's continuing stalemate at their meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.
Homer Simpson: Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. It's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. I want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again.
Bart Simpson: Okay.
Homer Simpson: Promise me.
Bart Simpson: I promise I will never watch that channel again.
Homer Simpson: Good boy.
Lisa Simpson: Hi, Dad. I think stealing cable is wrong. So I'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example. It's the last you'll hear from me on the matter. Thank you for your time.
Homer Simpson: Hey Lisa -- (CHANGING CHANNELS) Racing from Belmont? Horsies!
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven.
Homer Simpson: There is something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like... well, not like Bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium.
Marge Simpson: Well, you know, Bart was looking at that racy movie today, and Lisa's losing a little respect for you... Maybe we should think about unhooking the cable.
Homer Simpson: Unhook it?! But I love cable.
Marge Simpson: Well, then maybe you should pay for it.
Homer Simpson: Look, look, Marge. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't, so I'm not going to.
Marge Simpson: But Homer, I'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I never put my foot down about anything.
Marge Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: ...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I'm sorry, I think it's coming down.
Marge Simpson: No, Homer, not over this. No, no.
Homer Simpson: It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge. It's coming down. The cable stays. The foot has spoken.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: (YAWNS) Seen it. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it. Ugh! Soccer. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it.
Cable Guy: Hey, Simpson!
Homer Simpson: Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here?
Cable Guy: Well, your door wasn't locked in any serious way. I wonder if you'd be interested in this car stereo? A five hundred dollar value, but I'll let you have it for forty bucks.
Homer Simpson: Get out of my house! I don't wanna associate with criminals.
Cable Guy: Well, maybe I'll go see your neighbor.
Homer Simpson: He's not home.
Cable Guy: Even better.
Marge Simpson: Are you sure you want to do this, Homer? It doesn't look friendly.
Homer Simpson: Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff.
Bart Simpson: Come one, come all, Top Hat Theatre is on the air. The most beautiful women in the world. Just fifty-cents. I am your host, Bart Simpson. You must be at least eight years old to enter.
Bart Simpson: Well, back to the fight.
Top Hat Announcer: And now, the Top Hat Channel is honored to present, "Broadcast Nudes."
Milhouse Van Houten: Gross!
Martin Prince: Yet strangely compelling.
Milhouse Van Houten: It's a raid!
Homer Simpson: (SPUTTERING) Huh? What the? I know you -- come back here...
Homer Simpson: Bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! Now go to your room.
Bart Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Man, I wish I was an adult so I could break the rules.
Homer Simpson: Oh great.
Barney Gumble: Here, I brought some imported generic beer.
Marge Simpson: Thank you, Barney. (TO HOMER) How many people are coming, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Just a select circle of my friends.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh Hello, Mrs. Homer. I have brought an assortment of jerkies.
Homer Simpson: Oh, didja swipe those from work?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (OFFENDED) Certainly not. What has been implied here?
Boxing Announcer #1: Oh, no sir, there is no love lost between these two warriors. In fact, we almost had a scuffle earlier today, at the weigh-in.
Boxing Announcer #2: (TO FIGHTER #1) I understand you have a special motivation going into this bout.
Champ: Yeah, I want to dedicate this fight to my manager Vinnie, who got me here, and then (CHOKING UP) passed away just two weeks ago.
Boxing Announcer #2: Any response to that?
Challenger: Yeth, I would also like to dedicate thIS fight to the memory of his deceased manager.
Champ: You can't do that!
Challenger: I can do whatever I want!
Champ: You dedicate the fight to your manager, man!
Lisa Simpson: I just want to call attention to the fact that I'm not watching this fight. It's my form of non-violent protest.
Moe Szyslak: Hey, Homer, I brought ya...
Homer Simpson: Quick, it's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs...
Barney Gumble: Hey!
Homer Simpson: All right, will you... Hey, go protest outside will ya, now!.
Moe Szyslak: Hey, Homer. I brought you a mug.
Homer Simpson: (OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC) Oooh, thank you, Moe! I always wanted one of these.
Homer Simpson: Mr. Burns! Bart... quick. Hide the stuff I "borrowed" from work.
Homer Simpson: All right, the stuff I stole from work!
Bart Simpson: Oh, okay.
Homer Simpson: Now, c'mon. Take all this, and this, put it in the closet.
Homer Simpson: (TO LISA) Will you quit staring at me like that!
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, hello, Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: We were just in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by.
Homer Simpson: (STEPPING IN) Ugh, ah, hello, Mr. Burns. Would you like to watch the fight?
C. Montgomery Burns: The fight? Don't mind if I do. Oh, Simpson. Good news -- I brought some munchies. Smithers -- the Cheetos.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
Eddie: Are you Homer Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Yeah.
Lou: Word on the street is that you have an illegal cable hook-up.
Homer Simpson: (SPUTTERING) No... No I... It wasn't me... It was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... I would never...
Eddie: Hey, hey, settle down big fella.
Lou: We were, whoa, we were just wondering if we could watch the fight?
Homer Simpson: Oh, sure, sure. Be my guest.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, I brought you some lemonade for your protest.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks, Mom. It doesn't seem to be going very well.
Marge Simpson: Well, don't give up. When you love somebody you have to have faith that in the end they will do the right thing.
Boxing Announcer #2: The Challenger learned how to fight in the notorious projects of Capital City and honed his skills while serving time for aggravated assault and manslaughter in Springfield Prison.
Barney Gumble: All right, a local boy!
Challenger: For five years I was, I was incarcerated, away from my family and the mothers of my children. The conditions were irrevocable.
Homer Simpson: Oh, no.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMING) Marge, Lisa, Maggie...
Referee: Shake hands. Keep it clean.
Homer Simpson: (PANICKED) Come on, boy.
Homer Simpson: Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know I've made a couple of really important decisions. Number one: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. And Number Two: I'm not very fond of any of you.
Ranger Ned: (HORRIBLE SCREAMS)
Lisa Simpson: (HAPPILY) Dad, we may have saved your soul.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Yeah, at the worst possible time.
All: Eight... nine... ten... (YELLING)
Boxing Announcer #1: This fight is history! Stick a fork in it, it's done. A stunning knockout by a thunderous bolo punch in the closing seconds of the twelfth round, and Drederick Tatum is the new Champion of the World!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Everyone to my place for blueberry Squishees and microwave burritos!
Homer Simpson: The greatest fight ever and I missed it.
Lisa Simpson: We're really proud of you, Dad.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (TO BURNS) What a donnybrook game, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, hogwash! Why, I once watched Gentleman Jim Corbett fight an Eskimo fellow bare-knuckled for a hundred and thirteen rounds. Back then, of course, if a fight lasted less than fifty rounds, we demanded our nickel back.
Homer Simpson: Cable clippers, please.
Marge Simpson: Here you go, Homie.
Lisa Simpson: Go for it Dad!
Bart Simpson: Dad, I beg you to reconsider. Tractor pulls, Atlanta Braves baseball, Joe Franklin...
Homer Simpson: Oops.
Homer Simpson: Third time's the charm.

Marge Simpson: Homer, remember you promised you'd try to limit pork to six servings a week?
Seymour Skinner: (HOPEFUL) See me again tomorrow?
Homer Simpson: Marge, I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll unload the kids on Patty and Selma Saturday night. And then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. Just like old times.
Marge Simpson: (CROSSING TO THE PHONE) Saturday night? I'm not even sure my sisters will be available.

Seymour Skinner: Then the day after that.
Lisa Simpson: Poor Brandy. Aunt Selma, do you think you'll ever get married?
Selma Bouvier: Oh, I don't know. Why? You know somebody?
Lisa Simpson: No. And, since I'm sure that you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece, I'll simply hope that you're one of the statistically insignificant forty-year-old single women who ever find their fair Prince.
Marge Simpson: Patty! Selma! We're home.
Homer Simpson: I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me.
Selma Bouvier: Marge, I need to speak with you alone.
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! (OFF SNORING) No Barney, that's just my sister-in-law.

Marge Simpson: Well... I'll try.
Marge Simpson: Homer? Do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the Bowler's Hall of Fame in St. Louis, Missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin?
Homer Simpson: (FONDLY) Remember? Who could forget?
Marge Simpson: Then you'll also remember that you owe me a favor...

Homer Simpson: But that was just an idle promise.
Marge Simpson: Not to me.
Homer Simpson: (GROAN)
Marge Simpson: I want you to find a husband for my sister Selma.
Homer Simpson: Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?
Marge Simpson: She's the one who likes Police Academy movies and Hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched.
Marge Simpson: It's Patty who chose the life of celibacy. Selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her.
Homer Simpson: (WHINING) But Marge...
Marge Simpson: Homer, you will find her a man.
Homer Simpson: All right.
Marge Simpson: And not just any man.

Homer Simpson: (WEARILY) What is it this time?
Seymour Skinner: I'm afraid this time the victims are the innocent blades of grass on Groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field. If it's all right with you, Bart will repay his debt to society through back-breaking physical labor, re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed.
Homer Simpson: But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skinner, are you married?
Seymour Skinner: Only to my job.
Homer Simpson: But if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLING) Well, of course. These pants come off at night just like everyone else's. But tell me, why all the questions?
Homer Simpson: (COVERING) Oh, no reason, really. I was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. A payback for all the crummy things Bart has done to your school.

Seymour Skinner: (DREAMILY) Marvelous. Just marvelous.
Marge Simpson: (PROMPTING) Well, Selma hated Egypt, too. A camel spit on her.
Seymour Skinner: (NOT CARING) Oh, yes. I've heard they can be difficult. Patty, the Parents Advisory Board has asked that I attend the premiere of Space Mutants Part 5 tomorrow night. Would you be interested in joining me?
Patty Bouvier: (LOOKING AT SELMA) Well... I don't really think...

Seymour Skinner: (DETERMINED) The day after that, then.
Patty Bouvier: Seymour... you're touching me.
Seymour Skinner: (PASSIONATELY, MOVING CLOSER) Kiss me, Patty. I don't have cooties.

Executive #1: She was the Greek Goddess of Spring and rebirth.
HERB: (GROANS)
Executive #2: And get this, sir. She was carried off to Hades by the King of the Underworld. While there, she ate six pomegranates...
HERB: People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads. They want names like "Mustang" and "Cheetah" -- vicious animal names. The problem with you guys is you've forgotten your roots. (TO EXECUTIVE #2) You, what are your roots?
Executive #2: Well, I guess you could say they extend to when the Angles met the Saxons.

Homer Simpson: Oh, okay. I'd like a big one, then.
Otto Mann: Dook on!
Homer Simpson: Why not?
Executive #3: Because Americans don't want big cars.
Homer Simpson: Well, then give me one with lots of pep.
Executive #2: Sorry, our cars don't have pep.
HERB: Why not?
Executive #3: Because Americans want good mileage, not pep.
HERB: (TO HOMER) Homer, tell the nice man what country you come from.
Homer Simpson: America.
HERB: Do you hear that, you morons? This is why we're getting killed in the marketplace! Instead of listening to what people want, you're telling 'em what they want. Homer, I need your help.

Homer Simpson: What's that?
Head Engineer: The on-board computer.
Homer Simpson: All right. Wooo, what's that doohickey?
Head Engineer: Mr. Simpson, your brother told you to help us with this car now, didn't he?
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah, he did!
Head Engineer: (VERY CONDESCENDING) Hmmm hmmm, then why don't you get us some coffee.
Homer Simpson: (SADLY) Oh, okay.
Bart Simpson: Batting nine. Unky, Herbbbb!
Homer Simpson: Ugh, oh boy.
HERB: Hey Homer, how's your car coming?
Homer Simpson: Oh fine. We're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...
HERB: Homer...
Homer Simpson: Huh?
HERB: You didn't ask for rack and pinion steering, did you?
Homer Simpson: Uh, yeah, I think I did.
HERB: How could you ask for it? You don't even know what it is! You just called it rack and peanut steering.
Homer Simpson: Uh, may I be excused, please?
HERB: No! Homer, do you know why I gave you this job?
Homer Simpson: Because you think I'm a genius?
HERB: Nah, I don't think you're a genius.
Homer Simpson: Because you think I'm dynamic?
HERB: I don't think you're dynamic.
Homer Simpson: You think I work well with others?
HERB: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Homer, I gave you this job because you're an average schmoo.
Homer Simpson: (DEJECTED) Oh, great.
HERB: All you need is a little self-confidence.
Homer Simpson: (PLEADING) Ah, Unky Herb, I don't know anything about cars.
Head Engineer: Can do, Mr. S.
(Powell Motors Corporate Headquarters: ext. powell motors - day)
Bart Simpson: Bye, Unky Herb.
HERB: Up...up...up. Listen to me, here's what you do. From now on, before you say anything, say to yourself, "If I was ever sure of anything, I'm sure of this." Do you understand?
Homer Simpson: (MEEKLY) Sort of.
HERB: Homer!
Homer Simpson: What?
HERB: Answer me again with self-confidence.
Homer Simpson: (BELLOWING) Sort of!
HERB: Now go get 'em. (SHOUTS)
Homer Simpson: All right you eggheads! I want a place in this car to put my drink!
Head Engineer: Sir, the car has a beverage holder.
Homer Simpson: Hel-lo? Hel-lo Einstein? I said a place to put my drink. You know those Super Slakers they sell at the Kwik-E-Mart? (MAKING A BIG CIRCLE WITH HANDS) The cup is this big!
Head Engineer: (COWED) Extremely large beverage holder.
Homer Simpson: And I'm not done yet. You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car.
Head Engineer: (WRITING) Little... ball.
Homer Simpson: And some things are so snazzy they never go out of style! Like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!
Head Engineer: Bubble domes.

Lisa Simpson: What is it Unky Herb?
HERB: I want you to hear what the guys down at the plant think of your old man.
HERB: Y'ello.

Homer Simpson: I want a horn here, here and here. You can never find a horn when you're mad. And they should all play "La Cucaracha."
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM)
Homer Simpson: And sometimes, the kids are in the back seat, they're hollering, they're making you nuts. There's got to be something you can do about that.
Head Engineer: Maybe a built-in video game would keep them entertained?
Homer Simpson: You're fired! What is my brother paying you for?
Engineer #3: (TREMBLING) What about a separate sound proof bubble dome for the kids? With optional restraints and nuzzles.
Homer Simpson: Bullseye! And another thing. When I gun the motor, I want people to think the world is coming to an end! VROOM! VROOM! VROOM!

HERB: Oh good, good, good, good.

Homer Simpson: Powerful, like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding, like a Nerf ball. Now, at last, I have found it.

HERB: (TO HIMSELF) Ew.
HERB: Any questions?
Reporter: What does this monstrosity cost?
HERB: Uh, Jerry, what's the sticker price?
HERB: Eighty-two-thousand dollars! This monstrosity costs eighty-two-thousand dollars? What have I done! I mean the zoo was fun, but I'm ruined.
Lisa Simpson: Bye, Unky Herb.
Marge Simpson: Bye, Herb.
Homer Simpson: Gee, Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all your possessions. I can't help but think that maybe you would have been better off if I'd never come into your life.
HERB: Maybe I would have been better off?! Maybe? Why, you spongehead, of course I'd have been better off! As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother.
Homer Simpson: Ooo.

Marge Simpson: Time to get up, Lisa. (HAPPILY) It's a school day!
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, Lisa, you don't look well.
Lisa Simpson: I'll make it, Mom. Just tape my lunch box to my hand.

Dr. Julius Hibbert: (INTO PHONE) Uh, not that I'm angry, but how did you get my home number? (CHUCKLES) I see, quite ingenious.
Marge Simpson: Doctor, I think Lisa has the mumps.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (CHUCKLES) Well, Mrs. Simpson, much as I'd like to rely on your diagnosis, I think it might be professionally derelict of me to do so. Let me check my schedule.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Mm hm. Two o'clock is fine. Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.
Bart Simpson: No way! She's faking! If Lisa stays home, I stay home.
Lisa Simpson: If Bart stays home, I'm going to school.
Bart Simpson: Fine. Then... (TOTAL CONFUSION)
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Wait a minute. If Lisa goes to school then I go to school, but then Lisa stays home so I stay home, so Lisa goes to school...

Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh, are you? Well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard.
Sylvia Winfield: (INTO PHONE) There's only one family on this block... no, on earth... inconsiderate enough to let a monster like that roam free.
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? I am going to explain this to you one more time, and then I am going to hang up on you. (AS IF TO A VERY DIM-WITTED CHILD) It is not my dog. I tied my dog outside myself. I am looking at him right -- (ANNOYED GRUNT)

Emily: (TO CLASS) Ladies and gentlemen...
Emily: Most of you already know that, with a little (SACCHARINE) love and compassion, any puppy will grow up to be a cuddly little bundle of joy. Stuff and nonsense, taught by charlatans and learned by bloody twits. Let me tell you the two most important words you will ever hear in your life: choke chain.
Emily: You raise a dog the same way you would raise a child: with simple, authoritative commands... Lay down!
Emily: ...followed by immediate correction...
Martin Prince: How can we tell if we're doing this maneuver effectively?
Emily: The dog's eyes will cross and his tongue will protrude and change color ever so slightly.
Bart Simpson: Is my dog dead, ma'am?
Emily: (LAUGHING) You don't know how often I'm asked that. "Choke chain" is a misnomer. Trust me, they are always breathing.

(CANINE COLLEGE: EXT. CANINE COLLEGE - ESTABLISHING - DAY)

Lisa Simpson: Look, Mom, I finished my patch. It depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life.
Bart Simpson: Miss Winthrop, I was thinking...
Lisa Simpson: (COUGHS) On the left is Mr. Largo, my music teacher at school. He taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul. And on the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy. He taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth, so you better stick an instrument in front of it.
Marge Simpson: Hm.
Lisa Simpson: And look!
Marge Simpson: (PROUDLY) Come on, Homer. I want you to see what your sick little girl did.

Marge Simpson: MY QUILT! Six generations, gone. (CRIES)
Homer Simpson: (CALMLY) Now Marge, honey, honey, honey. Come on. Come on, don't get upset. It's not the end of the world. We all loved that quilt, but you can't get too attached to...

Homer Simpson: We never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.
Marge Simpson: Homer, what are you saying?

Bart Simpson: No way! You can't give my dog away! I'll set fire to my hair! I'll rip up all my clothes! I'll put sugar in the gas tank!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Lisa Simpson: I've suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog. But when I look into his vacant brown eyes, I just can't bear to let him go. I'm sure Mom agrees with me.
Marge Simpson: No, I'm afraid I agree with your father.
Homer Simpson: You do? (TAUNTING) Ha ha, ha ha ha!
Marge Simpson: Homer, please. It's not just the quilt. He's a nice dog, but he chews up everything. He doesn't obey. He's not even housebroken. And we've spent all this money on an obedience school and I don't see any improvement.
Bart Simpson: All right, all right. If Santa's Little Helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog, can we keep him then?
Homer Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: Dad!
Emily: Tch, tch. Oh, dear.
Bart Simpson: ...since you get paid either way, would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, this is our pet. We can question his integrity and disposition, but we can't question his heart. Are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away?
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING) Oh Lisa, if they're ever going to pull the plug on me, I want you in my corner, honey.
Marge Simpson: Oh, all right. If he passes obedience school, we can keep him.
Lisa Simpson: Yea!

Homer Simpson: Stop it, both of you. Grampa smells like a regular old man, which is more like a hallway in a hospital.
Marge Simpson: Homer, that's terrible. We should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly. You know, we'll be old someday.
Homer Simpson: My God, you're right, Marge. You kids wouldn't put me in a home like I did to my dad, would you?
Bart Simpson: Well...
Homer Simpson: (SCREAM) Marge, what do we do?

Grampa Simpson: We'll I'm Abraham J. Simpson. Care to tip the wrist with me?
BEA: I would be delighted.
BEA: So, tell me about yourself.
Grampa Simpson: Eh, widower, one son, one working kidney. And you?

Grampa Simpson: You left something out. Ravishing!
Grampa Simpson: And, what are you eh, doing tonight?

Grampa Simpson: (Disappointed) Oh. Well, if you've got plans already...
BEA: No, what were you going to say?
Grampa Simpson: Ah, nothin'.
BEA: Oh, Abe, you were going to say something.
Grampa Simpson: (AWKWARDLY) Well, I was wondering if you and I, you know, might go to the same place at the same time and ... Geez, you'd think this would get easier with time.
BEA: I'd love to.
Grampa Simpson: Okay, now, where's that pomade?

Herman Hermann: (INTERRUPTING) Ah, Grampa, nothing says "I love you" better than a military antique.
Herman Hermann: Let's take a look at the bayonet case. Huh?
Grampa Simpson: Hey, what's that?
Herman Hermann: That, my friend, was Napoleon's hat.
Grampa Simpson: It doesn't look like Napoleon's hat.
Herman Hermann: Well, it's not the famous hat. It's the one he wore for a week in April, 1796, just before he defeated the Sardinians.
Grampa Simpson: Ooh. How much?
Herman Hermann: Four hundred dollars.
Grampa Simpson: I'll give you five bucks.
Herman Hermann: That's not the kind of offer you should make to a man with a Gattling gun under the counter. Why don't you try Grandma's World.

Grampa Simpson: Ohhhhh, noooo.
Jasper Beardly: It was her ticker. The Doc said her left ventricle burst.

Grampa Simpson: A hundred and six thousand dollars?
Lionel Hutz: Ta-ta, Mr. Simpson. By the way, old timer, I do wills. Why don't I just give you this pen with my phone number on it. It looks just like a cigar! Isn't that something!

Lisa Simpson: Grampa, that's the noblest thought that's ever been expressed at this table.
Bart Simpson: Give it to us, Grampa.

C. Montgomery Burns: You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, old man.
Moe Szyslak: Here's the deal, Grampa. A guy, I think was an explorer, left this in the bar one night. It may be a map to ancient treasure, or directions to some guy's house, but to find out, we'll need money, we'll need provisions, and a two man diving bell.

Professor Jonathan Frink: You know, my wife will be happy. She's hated this whole death ray thing from day one.
Grampa Simpson: (WEARILY) Oh Lisa. What makes you think you deserve all that money?
Lisa Simpson: I don't deserve it, Grampa. No one here does. The people who deserve it are on the streets and they're in the slums. They're little children who need more library books and families who can't make ends meet. Of course, if you really wanted to, you could buy me a pony.
Grampa Simpson: You're right.
Lisa Simpson: I'll name her Princess and I'll ride her every day.

Grampa Simpson: No, I'll have you know, I've decided to give my money away to truly needy causes. But a hundred thousand dollars just isn't enough. I need more.

Grampa Simpson: Sorry, boy, I have to get enough to help everybody.
Homer Simpson: But you could lose everything. Come on.
Grampa Simpson: Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: "If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss and lose, and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss... Yours is the earth and everything that's in it. And -- which is more -- you'll be a man, my son."

Lisa Simpson: Mom...
(COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTRATION: int. community college registration - a few moments later)
Professor Lombardo: Very good... Fabulous... Ooh, even better... You have real talent.
Marge Simpson: Do you really think so? My high school art teacher hated them.
Professor Lombardo: What? The man was a fool! But, still, one must admire the force of his conviction.
Marge Simpson: Then I'm in the class?
Professor Lombardo: Oh my dear, there couldn't be a class without you. Now if you'll excuse me, nature calls!
Professor Lombardo: Marvelous!
(Simpson Living Room: ext. simpson living room - day)
Bart Simpson: The Heavy Hands don't work unless you move, Homer.
Homer Simpson: I can't move, boy.
Bart Simpson: Oh really.
(Professor Lombardo's Class: int. professor lombardo's class - later that evening)
Professor Lombardo: Now, using the "Lombardo Method", you learn to see everyday objects as a simple grouping of geometrical shapes.
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, find me an artist.
(BROKERAGE: Int. brokerage - continuous)
Professor Lombardo: Here we see how two concentric circles, various trapezoids, ellipses and, yes, even a rhombus, can create an adorable little bunny rabbit!
Professor Lombardo: It's just that easy!
Marge Simpson: (CONFUSED MURMUR)
Lisa Simpson: Lincoln Lincoln I been thinkin' what the hell have you been drinkin'? / Is it water is it wine? / Oh my God it's turpentine! / Faster! Faster!
Homer Simpson: (GRUNTS REPEATEDLY)
(Community College Painting Studio: int. community college painting studio - night)
Professor Lombardo: (APPLAUDING) Bravo. (TO ANOTHER STUDENT) Walk away from it! Now it belongs to the ages. (TO ANOTHER STUDENT) You, not another stroke. Oh well, maybe one more. That's it! Perfect!
Professor Lombardo: Mmmm. Indeed. Marge, you find the inner beauty of your subject and bring it out for all to see.
Marge Simpson: Well, thank you, Professor Lombardo.
Professor Lombardo: Well, you're welcome, my dear! (LOW VOICE) Marge, walk with me.
Professor Lombardo: Marge, they've asked me to submit the best painting from my class to the Springfield Art Exhibition next week. I've decided to choose your "Bald Adonis"?
Marge Simpson: Really? You're so supportive. I wish every teacher was like you.
Professor Lombardo: Marge, please. I don't take praise very well.
Professor Lombardo: (TO JANITOR) Oh, another triumph!
(OLD ARMORY HALL: int. old armory hall - a week later)
Marge Simpson: I can't believe it.
BART & LISA: Yay, Mom!
Homer Simpson: Woo-ooo! I'm a work of art! "Last Supper", eat your heart out!
(Burns's Office: int. burns' office - the next day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Garbage! What matchbook art school did you flunk out of, you ham-fisted, nearsighted house painter? Smithers, throw this on the dung heap.
Artist: I'm sorry, but this isn't working out. I quit.
C. Montgomery Burns: (INNOCENTLY) Well, Smithers, I guess that's what you call your "artistic temperament".
Waylon Smithers: Sir, I must remind you that the dedication of the Burns Wing of the museum is only six days away.
C. Montgomery Burns: Damnation, Smithers! This idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait was as half-baked as your idea about me having children!
Marge Simpson: Okay, shoot.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, I'm afraid you've systematically alienated Springfield's entire art community. The only one left is this Mrs. Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONFUSED) Who?
Waylon Smithers: (LOOKING OVER THE ARTICLE) Well, she won first prize in the Springfield Art Fair, and as the wife of an employee, she'll be easily intimidated.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. Once again the wheel has turned and Dame Fortune has hugged Montgomery Burns to her sweet perfumed bosom. Somebody up there likes me, Smithers.
Waylon Smithers: Somebody down here likes you, too, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up.
Homer Simpson: Woo woo! Two forty nine! Yeah!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - morning)
Homer Simpson: Marge, Marge. Look at me! My clothes are just hanging off me!
Marge Simpson: Oh, that's wonderful, isn't it kids?
Lisa Simpson: Pass the moo juice.
Marge Simpson: Kids. Remember what I told you about showing a little support.
Lisa Simpson: Way to go, Dad.
Bart Simpson: You look mahvelous.
Homer Simpson: (TEARY) What a family.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. POWER PLANT - SNACK AREA - DAY)
Delivery Man: Hey, what gives? These donuts are pilin' up!
Carl Carlson: Yeah, Homer Simpson went on a diet.
Delivery Man: Oh my God! And I just bought a boat!
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, don't people answer the door these days?
Waylon Smithers: Allow me, sir.
Waylon Smithers: Open up!
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns. Would you like to come in?
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns would like to commission you to do a portrait of him. Have you ever painted the rich and powerful?
Marge Simpson: Well, no... just Ringo Starr.
C. Montgomery Burns: (WITH DIFFICULTY) Rin-go?
Waylon Smithers: He was the drummer for a rock 'n roll combo called the Beatles, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Beatles, eh? Oh, yes. I seem to remember their off-key caterwauling on the old Sullivan show. What was he thinking? (TO MARGE) Mrs. Simpson, this commission and all its glory can be yours, but first you must look me straight in the eye and answer one simple question.
C. Montgomery Burns: Can you make me beautiful?
Marge Simpson: I don't think that will be a problem.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm no matinee idol.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe not, but I have the gift of being able to see inner beauty.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmmm. (NODS) Mrs. Simpson, you may immortalize me.
Waylon Smithers: Ah, sir, at last the world will see you as I always have.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, yes, yes! Now don't be stingy with the blush, Smithers.
MR. BURNS' GEOMETRIC SHAPES: Now you! Paint!
Homer Simpson: Honey, I'm home!
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, there's an original sentiment.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
C. Montgomery Burns: Take it outside, Simpson. I'm male modeling.
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) I'm painting his portrait, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (FALSELY CHEERY) Oh, isn't that wonderful. My work and my home life come together in such a nice way. (LOW) Marge, may I see you in the other room?
Homer Simpson: Honey, he's nuts. He thinks he's handsome. Please, make him look handsome. Please, please, please, please...
Marge Simpson: Now, Homer, don't worry. All I need to do is find Mr. Burns' inner beauty.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
Marge Simpson: What were you like as a boy, Mr. Burns? Did you have a dog that you loved.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, aieeee! There's something on my leg! Get it off! Get it off!
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns, she's just a baby.
Homer Simpson: All right, all right, who took the funny pages?
Waylon Smithers: So, Ziggy goes to the repair shop and there's a sign on the doorbell reading "Out Of Order."
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLE) Ah, Ziggy... will you ever win?
Marge Simpson: Oh, my.
C. Montgomery Burns: (COVERING HIMSELF) If you'll excuse me, I'm changing for a board meeting.
Marge Simpson: (FLUSTERED) I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Mom. Did he have those spots all over his body?
C. Montgomery Burns: (STICKING HEAD OUT) I heard that.
Bart Simpson: Oops.
Waylon Smithers: Would you feel more comfortable if I left, too, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: Of course not, Smithers. You're like a doctor.
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, I want my tea!
Marge Simpson: Doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?
Waylon Smithers: (CHUCKLES) Actually, I value every second we're together -- from the moment I squeeze his orange juice in the morning, till I tuck him in at night. He's not just my boss, he's my best friend, too.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TASTING) Bah! Too hot!
Waylon Smithers: You're right, sir. It's scalding me as we speak.
(ENGLISH COUNTRY MANOR: ext. english country manor - day)
RINGO: (AS HE TYPES) Dear Sally. In response to your letter of December the twelfth 1966, me favorite color is blue and me real first name is Richard. Thanks for the snapshot. You're a real cute bird. Luv, Ringo. P.S. Forgive the lateness of my reply.
WETHERBY: Mr. Starr, tea and crumpets.
RINGO: (PREOCCUPIED) Just set it over there.
WETHERBY: Sir, if you'll forgive an old Brit his impertinence, your devotion to your fans is nothing short of remarkable.
RINGO: Well, Wetherby, they took the time to write me and I don't care if it takes me another twenty years... I'm going to answer every one of them.
RINGO: (RE: PACKAGE) Hello! What's this?
RINGO: From Springfield, U.S.A.
RINGO: (DELIGHTED) Gear!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Will you cease that infernal tootling!
Lisa Simpson: I was just practicing.
Marge Simpson: (THROUGH HER TEETH) Mr. Burns, it's hard to discover your inner beauty while you're shouting at an eight-year-old girl.
C. Montgomery Burns: We've only got two days left, so I'd advise you to shut up and paint!
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS ANGRILY)
Homer Simpson: All right, scale. You don't like me and I don't like you, but I've been very good, so you better treat me right.
Homer Simpson: All right! Woo woo! Woo woo!
Homer Simpson: Marge! I'm two-thirty-nine and I'm feeling fine! Look! I'm using the original notches that came with my belt.
Marge Simpson: That's wonderful Homer, I'm so proud of...
C. Montgomery Burns: Let me get this straight. You're pleased with your current appearance? (LAUGHS) Ah, why my good man, you're the fattest thing I've ever seen. And I've been on safari.
Homer Simpson: (SNIFFLING) If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator.
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns, I've had enough of your... posing. I can finish the portrait myself.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO SMITHERS) Thank goodness. Another day in this suburban nightmare and I would've needed half a white valium. (TO MARGE, CHEERY) Thank you for your gracious hospitality. See you at the unveiling.
Marge Simpson: Homer, what are you doing?!
Homer Simpson: No. Burns is right. What's the use?
Marge Simpson: Don't you listen to him. He's just a mean little S.O.B.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Marge.
Marge Simpson: I thought there was some good in everybody until I met him.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, well, just so long as you paint a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow.
Marge Simpson: I don't think I can.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) What?! Marge, you have to.
Marge Simpson: I can't make that man beautiful. I'm just not good enough. I guess I'm no artist.
Homer Simpson: Hello, what's this?
Homer Simpson: It's for you, Marge. From merry old England.
Marge Simpson: (EXCITED) From the desk of Ringo Starr!
RINGO: Dear Marge. Thanks for the fab painting of yours truly. I hung it on me wall. You're quite an artist. In answer to your question, yes, we do have hamburgers and fries in England, but we call french fries chips. Luv, Ringo. P.S. Forgive the lateness of my reply.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS DREAMILY)
Homer Simpson: Come on, Marge. Paint. I think you can do it.
Marge Simpson: (COYLY) Okay, Homer. If you think I can.
(SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM: ext. springfield art museum - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Friends, art lovers, security personnel. Today is a red letter day for the Springfield Palace of Fine Art. A new wing for our museum and a portrait commemorating the man who ponied up the dough.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ladies and gentlemen, may I invite you to behold... Montgomery Burns!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers!
Professor Lombardo: I don't care for this at all.
Kids: (LOUDER) Ewwwwww!
Martin Prince: Mrs. Krabappel, he's traumatizing the children.
Bart Simpson: More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos!
Marge Simpson: Umm... Hello. My name is Marge Simpson and I painted this. Maybe you'd like to know what possessed me to do it. Well, I guess I wanted to show that beneath Mr. Burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain, there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of God's creatures.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Provocative, but powerful.
MRS. HOOVER: He's bad, but he'll die. So I like it.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CALLING) Marge... a word, please.
C. Montgomery Burns: You know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate. And I don't hate this. Your painting is bold but beautiful. (CONFIDENTIALLY) And uh, incidentally, thanks for not making fun of my genitalia.
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) I thought I did.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. ELEMENTARY - LISA'S CLASSROOM - MORNING)
JANEY: Did you hear about Miss Hoover? She drank a bottle of drain cleaner by mistake.
Chuck: Uh, I heard she fell down a well.
Seymour Skinner: Come on now. Oh.
Lisa Simpson: My god, she's been dumped again.
Miss Hoover: Children, I won't be staying long. I just came from the doctor and I have Lyme disease. Principal Skinner will run the class until a substitute arrives.
Ralph Wiggum: (RAISING HAND) What's Lyme disease?
Seymour Skinner: Uh, I'll field that one. Lyme disease is spread by small parasites, called ticks. When a diseased tick attaches itself to you and begins sucking your blood,
Miss Hoover: (ANGUISHED SIGH)
Seymour Skinner: Malignant spirochetes infest your bloodstream, eventually spreading to your spinal fluid, and on into the brain.
Miss Hoover: The brain? Oh, dear God!
Seymour Skinner: Come on, Elizabeth. Come, come.
Seymour Skinner: (TOO FRIENDLY) Well now, children, here we are, open your primers to page 32.
Seymour Skinner: Ah, substraction.
Seymour Skinner: (ANGRY) Bart Simpson... I know it's you.
Bart Simpson: (MATTER OF FACT) And here comes Snowball II. This is the one we kept.
Kids: Ewwwwwww!
Bart Simpson: We were going to keep the gray one, but the mother ate her.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: As usual, I agree with you, Martin. Bart, shut that off and take your seat immediately.
Bart Simpson: (PICKING UP REMOTE CONTROL) Oh look, this is really cool. When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in.
Kids: (SCREAM)
Seymour Skinner: No children, your not seeing things, this, my little friends, is a schwa.
Seymour Skinner: Are you the substitute?
BERGSTROM: Yes, sir. Yes I am.
Seymour Skinner: Are you insane?
BERGSTROM: No, no sir. No, I'm not. It's my way of getting their attention.
Seymour Skinner: Well, all right. (TO KIDS, TOO FRIENDLY) Play friendly with your new teacher, children!
BERGSTROM: (TEXAS ACCENT) Howdy. I am a Texas cowboy. The year is 1830. You young'uns ask me any questions you like.
Chuck: (RAISING HAND) Can we play kickball instead of science after lunch?
BERGSTROM: Kickball? Son, there ain't no kickball in 1830. Any other questions?
BERGSTROM: Shoot! It's awfully quiet on the plains here. Well, how about this? Everybody, I want to see two eyes on every single person staring right at me, right now. There are three things wrong with my costume. Anybody names those three things will get my hat.
Lisa Simpson: (RAISING HAND) I believe I know the answer.
BERGSTROM: Well, well, wha... wha...what's your name?
Lisa Simpson: Lisa Simpson.
BERGSTROM: Well, go ahead, Miss Simpson.
Lisa Simpson: Um, one: Your belt buckle says "State of Texas", but Texas wasn't a state until 1845.
BERGSTROM: Very good.
Lisa Simpson: Two: the revolver wasn't invented until 1835.
BERGSTROM: That's excellent.
Lisa Simpson: Three: You seem to be of the Jewish faith.
BERGSTROM: Are you sure I'm Jewish?
Lisa Simpson: Or Italian?
BERGSTROM: I'm Jewish.
Lisa Simpson: And there weren't any Jewish cowboys.
Terri/sherri: Speech! Speech!
Bart Simpson: I had a speech ready... but my dog ate it!
Kids: (LAUGHING)
BERGSTROM: Very good! That's excellent! And I'm also wearing a digital watch, but I'll accept that. Here you go, little lady. And for the record there were a few Jewish cowboys, ladies and gentlemen. Big guys, who were great shots, and spent money freely. I'm Mr. Bergstrom. Feel free to make fun of my name if you want. Two suggestions are Mister Nerdstrom and Mister Boogerstrom.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Boys and girls, today we will begin selecting a class president.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I'm not allowed to vote, but I strongly suggest you elect Martin. Martin...
Martin Prince: As your president, I would demand a science fiction library featuring an A-B-C of the Overlords of the genre: Asimov, Master, Clarke...
Wendell Borton: (RAISING HAND) What about Ray Bradbury?
Martin Prince: (DISMISSING) I'm aware of his work. (TO CLASS) Thank you and (OMINOUSLY) keep watching the skies.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Excellent (APPLAUDING) Excellent, Martin.
BERGSTROM: If you're through with your pemmican, why don't we sing a song about cowboys? Now this one's not very accurate, but we can fix it up as we go along. Okay?
BERGSTROM: (SINGING) Home, home on the range. (SPEAKING QUICKLY) Actually, the range was far from home, it was a very desolate place where danger and disease rode tall in the saddle. (SINGING) Where the deer and the antelope play. (SPEAKING) Unlike the efficient Indians, cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope and they threw the rest away.
BERGSTROM: (SINGING) Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.
BERGSTROM: Hey, what's this? Did you do it?
Lisa Simpson: (NERVOUS) No! No! It wasn't me! I would never do anything like that. It was just one of those immature people who, instead of building themselves up --
BERGSTROM: It's neat. Can I have it? (TO CLASS)
Lisa Simpson: Yes, but I didn't do it.
BERGSTROM: Are you sure you didn't do it? It's good.
Lisa Simpson: No, but I'm starting to wish I had.
BERGSTROM: (CHUCKLES) Ladies and gentlemen, the Singing Dork!
Classmate: (WHISPERS) Lisa (CHUCKLES)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Any other nominations?
Terri/sherri: We nominate Bart Simpson!
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - continuous)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Children! (FRIENDLY) Bart, I need someone very reliable to deliver an important message to the principal's office.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Would you do it for me?
Bart Simpson: (PLAYING TO CROWD) Why, Mrs. Krabappel! How would I know where the principal's office is?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: People, what have I told you about encouraging him? When Bart wins approval for making a fool of himself, it makes him think that --
Milhouse Van Houten: (POINTING TO DOOR) Yay, Bart!
BERGSTROM: (READING IN A WHISPER) Nobody, of the hundreds of people that visited the fair, knew that a grey spider had played the most important part of all. No one was with her when she died."
BERGSTROM: Come on, Janey, everybody has a talent. I want to see yours, that's all.
JANEY: I don't have a talent.
BERGSTROM: You cannot talk like that. There has to be something that you can do better than anybody else.
JANEY: Well, I can do this --
BERGSTROM: Yes! Great! Ok, how about you, Ralph?
BERGSTROM: Wonderful! Chuck?
BERGSTROM: Oh, that's disgusting. I love it! Lisa... come on, you're holding out on us. I see a saxophone over there!
Lisa Simpson: I can't.
BERGSTROM: Come on, Lisa, I bet you're good.
Lisa Simpson: No, really, I can't.
BERGSTROM: Sure you can; just try.
Lisa Simpson: Please don't make me do it.
BERGSTROM: All right. You owe me something special.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: So while I'm technically still married, there really hasn't been any marriage to speak of since Mister Krabappel moved into his little "love nest."
BERGSTROM: This profession can put a lot of strain on a marriage.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (ENTICINGLY) Since he's been gone, I've been looking for a substitute to teach me a lesson I sorely need.
BERGSTROM: (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Mrs. Krabappel, you're trying to seduce me.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well...
BERGSTROM: I'm sorry, Mrs. Krabappel, you're very nice, but it's the children I love.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - THE NEXT MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: (DREAMILY) When I fall asleep, Mr. Bergstrom is the last thing I think of, and he's my first thought when I wake up.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, I feel that way about your father.
Lisa Simpson: No, no. You don't understand. (DREAMILY) When Mr. Bergstrom smiles, you only see these teeth --
Lisa Simpson: -- but when you really make him laugh, you can see these two teeth. I think they're called the eye teeth.
Lisa Simpson: I don't know if he had orthodontic work or what, but they're absolutely perfect.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, I notice little things about your father, too.
Lisa Simpson: No, Mom. This is different. I mean, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better.
Marge Simpson: (FIRMLY) Your father does that to me.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, are we gonna talk, or are we gonna talk?
Marge Simpson: (MEASURED ANGER) Lisa, we can talk, but first you have to accept the fact that I feel that way about your father!
Lisa Simpson: Fine.
Lisa Simpson: (TO MARGE) Yesterday, he read us "Charlotte's Web", and cried at the end, never trying to hide his tears.
Homer Simpson: A book made him cry! Boo hoo hoo!
Bart Simpson: (RUBBING EYES) Waaaaaaaah!
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. ELEMENTARY - LISA'S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON)
BERGSTROM: Remember, nobody, and I mean nobody gets back in after lunch without one igneous rock, that's volcanic, and one sedimentary, and that is layered. Lisa, can I see to you for a minute.
Lisa Simpson: (LOW) Yes! (LOUDER) Yes, Mr. Bergstrom?
BERGSTROM: Lisa, your homework is always so neat. How can I put this? Does your father help you with it?
Lisa Simpson: No. Homework's not my father's specialty.
BERGSTROM: Well, there's no shame in it. I mean my Dad could really --
Lisa Simpson: Not mine.
BERGSTROM: You didn't let me finish.
Lisa Simpson: Unless the next word was burp, you didn't have to.
(Elementary - Bart's Classroom: INT. ELEMENTARY - BART'S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON)
Martin Prince: In a sample taken in this very classroom, a state inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos --
Bart Simpson: That's not enough! We demand more asbestos! More Asbestos!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Homer Simpson: Wow! You made the front page.
Bart Simpson: (DISMISSING) Aw, Dad. It's just a popularity contest.
Homer Simpson: Just a popularity contest?! Excuse me, what's more important than popularity? Now, Bart, do you really think you can win?
Bart Simpson: Sure, why not?
Homer Simpson: Woo woo! All right! I always knew you had personality. The doctors said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better. (SAVORING) President Simpson. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?
Bart Simpson: (WARMING TO IT) Hm, yeah.
Homer Simpson: Now, go get 'em.
Bart Simpson: He says, there aren't any easy answers! I say, he's not looking hard enough!
Kids: Yay!
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. ELEMENTARY - LISA'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS)
Lisa Simpson: Oh, you'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator.
BERGSTROM: (POINTS TO BART) You're going to miss your brother's antics.
Lisa Simpson: When?
BERGSTROM: When? When your life takes you places the rest of us have only heard about.
Lisa Simpson: Places where my intelligence will be an asset, not a liability?
BERGSTROM: Yes, there is such a place, believe me. It's true.
Lisa Simpson: I believe everything you say, with your words, your body language and your Semitic good looks.
Ralph Wiggum: (READING) "Dear Miss Hoover: You have Lyme disease. We miss you. Kevin's biting me. Come back soon. Here is a drawing of a spirochete. Love, Ralph."
BERGSTROM: Oh, that's great, Ralph!
BERGSTROM: Hey, kids. I've learned that in two weeks the Springfield Museum of Natural History will be closing forever due to a lack of interest. I urge you to see it while you can.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVINGING ROOM - THAT NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and I think you should take her.
Homer Simpson: The Museum!
Marge Simpson: Hmmm huh.
Homer Simpson: Tomorrow... ugh; oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on... sleeping... eating a big sandwich... watching T.V... spending some time with the boy. Spending time with the boy. The boy needs attention, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Homer, I've been talking to Lisa and I'm concerned about your relationship with her.
Bart Simpson: (MOCK CONCERN) Me, too, Mom. I think they're drifting apart.
Homer Simpson: Shut up, boy.
Marge Simpson: Homer, please.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because... you're trapped. If you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! All right! I'll take her. (TO HIMSELF) Lousy brain.
(Museum: INT. MUSEUM - ADMISSION AREA - DAY)
Homer Simpson: Hey, what do you mean by, "Suggested Donation"?
Woman In Booth: Pay any amount you wish, sir.
Homer Simpson: And what if I "wish" to pay zero?
Woman In Booth: Then it's up to you.
Homer Simpson: Oooh, so it's up to me, is it?
Woman In Booth: Yes.
Homer Simpson: (CHORTLES) I see, and you think that people are gonna pay you four dollars and fifty cents, even though they don't have to, just out of the goodness of their... (SCORNFUL LAUGH) Well, anything you say! Good luck, lady! You're gonna need it!
Lisa Simpson: (DELIGHTED) Mr. Bergstrom!
BERGSTROM: Hi, Lisa.
Homer Simpson: Hey! You don't have to pay! Read the sign!
BERGSTROM: (TO LISA) And this must be your father.
BERGSTROM: His teeth had jagged edges to rip through your body, but he could've swallowed you whole!
Lisa Simpson: Wow!
BERGSTROM: Actually, Mr. Simpson, they do know a great deal about the process of mummification. First, they pulled the brain out through the nose with an iron hook, and stuffed the insides with sawdust and onions!
Lisa Simpson: Ewww. Gross.
Homer Simpson: Ohh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than of the Wolf Man.
Lisa Simpson: Oh Lord.
BERGSTROM: Mr. Simpson... I'm gonna be presumptuous. I have noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
Homer Simpson: She said that?
BERGSTROM: Well, no, she didn't say it, but, you know, she...
Homer Simpson: (SHAKY) But you can tell, right? She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, "Why me? What did I do to deserve this fat old piece of -- " (CRYING)
BERGSTROM: Mr. Simpson, you have got to be a bigger man. There is a wonderful girl's future at stake.
Homer Simpson: (SNAPPING OUT OF IT) Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A.
BERGSTROM: I am giving her an A.
Homer Simpson: Great. But don't tell her it was a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.
BERGSTROM: Mr. Simpson, she did earn it.
Homer Simpson: You are smooth. I'll give you that.
(SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRCASE: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: He ruined the one chance I had of getting to know Mr. Bergstrom outside of school.
Marge Simpson: Well... I'll tell you what. Why don't we invite Mr. Bergstrom to dinner?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, Mom, that's wonderful. Can I find out his favorite dish and help you make it!
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Lisa Simpson: Can I wear your jewelry?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Lisa Simpson: Can I get my ears pierced?
Marge Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Can I dye my shoes pink?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Lisa Simpson: Can I paint my nails?
Marge Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Can we have wine?

Miss Hoover: Good morning, Lisa.
Miss Hoover: (OFF LISA'S REACTION) I'm back.
Miss Hoover: You see, class, my Lyme disease turned out to be...
Miss Hoover: Psy-cho-so-ma-tic.
Ralph Wiggum: Does that mean you were crazy?
JANEY: No, that means she was faking it.
Miss Hoover: No, actually, it was a little of both. Sometimes when a disease is in all the magazines and all the news shows, it's only natural that you think you have it.
Lisa Simpson: (NEAR TEARS) Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
Miss Hoover: I don't know. Although I'd sure like to talk to him. He didn't touch my lesson plan. What did he teach you?
Lisa Simpson: That life is worth living.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: The polls will be open from now until the end of recess. Now, (SOUR) just in case any of you have decided to put any thought into this, we'll have our final statements. Martin?
Martin Prince: (HOARSE WHISPER) I don't think there's anything left to say.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Bart?
Bart Simpson: Victory party under the slide!
(Apartment Building: Ext. apartment building - day)
Lisa Simpson: (CALLING) Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom!
Landlady: Hey, hey, he Moved out this morning. He must have a new job -- he took his Copernicus costume.
Lisa Simpson: Do you know where I could find him?
Landlady: I think he's taking the next train to Capital City.
Lisa Simpson: The train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound.
Landlady: Yes, and it's been the backbone of our country since Leland Stanford drove that golden spike at Promontory point.
Lisa Simpson: I see he touched you, too.
(Springfield Elementary School: EXT. ELEMENTARY - SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON)
Bart Simpson: Hey, thanks for your vote, man.
Nelson Muntz: I didn't vote. Voting's for geeks.
Bart Simpson: Well, you got that right. (TO TERRI AND SHERRI) Thanks for your vote, girls.
Terri/sherri: We forgot.
Bart Simpson: Well, don't sweat it. Just so long as a couple of people did... right, Milhouse?
Milhouse Van Houten: Uh oh.
Bart Simpson: Lewis?
Bart Simpson: (LOUDER) Somebody must have voted.
Milhouse Van Houten: What about you, Bart? Didn't you vote?
Bart Simpson: Uh oh.
Bart Simpson: (ANGUISHED SCREAM)
Wendell Borton: Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - evening)
Bart Simpson: (TO MRS. KRABAPPEL) I demand a recount.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: One for Martin, two for Martin. Would you like another recount?
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) No.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (RELISHING IT) Well, I just want to make sure. One for Martin. Two for Martin.
Kid Reporter: (TO MARTIN) This way, Mister President!
(Train Station: int. train station - afternoon)
Conductor: Now boarding on track 5, The afternoon delight coming to Shelbyville, Parkville, and…..
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!
BERGSTROM: Hey, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: Hey, Lisa, indeed.
BERGSTROM: What? What is it?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?
BERGSTROM: Ah, I'm sorry, Lisa. You know, it's the life of the substitute teacher: he's a fraud. Today he might be wearing gym shorts, tomorrow he's speaking French, or, or, or pretending to know how to run a band saw, or God knows what.
Lisa Simpson: You can't go! You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
BERGSTROM: Ah, that's not true. Other teachers will come along who...
Lisa Simpson: Oh, please.
BERGSTROM: No, I can't lie to you, I am the best. But, you know, they need me over in the projects of Capital City.
Lisa Simpson: But I need you too.
BERGSTROM: That's the problem with being middle class. Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.
Lisa Simpson: (SNIFFLING) I, I understand. Mr. Bergstrom, I'm going to miss you.
BERGSTROM: I'll tell you what...
BERGSTROM: Whenever you feel like you're alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know.
Lisa Simpson: (CHOKED UP) Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom.
Conductor: All aboard!
Lisa Simpson: So, I guess this is it? It you don't mind I'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?
BERGSTROM: Goodbye, Lisa honey. It'll be okay. Just read the note.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - night)
Homer Simpson: (INDIGNANT) Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
Homer Simpson: (MULLING IT OVER, LOW, TO HIMSELF) Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. (TRYING TO CONVINCE HIMSELF) Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. (NOTICING LISA) What are you so mopey about?
Lisa Simpson: Nothing.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, tell your father.
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Bergstrom left today.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Lisa Simpson: He's gone. Forever.
Homer Simpson: And?
Lisa Simpson: I didn't think you'd understand.
Homer Simpson: Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
Lisa Simpson: (FIGHTING BACK TEARS) I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED) Me?
Lisa Simpson: Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!
Homer Simpson: I don't think you realize what you're saying.
Lisa Simpson: Baboon!
Bart Simpson: Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can't believe it was her.
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED) Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!
Marge Simpson: Homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There's a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy.
Homer Simpson: (READING THE SIGN) Go Away.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?
Lisa Simpson: No!
Homer Simpson: Nuts.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) This isn't going well at all.
Lisa Simpson: Look, if you just want me to forgive you --
Homer Simpson: No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say.
Homer Simpson: Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof.
Lisa Simpson: (MOANS)
Marge Simpson: That was our wedding.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Marge Simpson: (LOOKS UP) Children, it's time for you to go to bed.
Homer Simpson: (PATS HER HEAD) It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. (BEAT) Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah.
Homer Simpson: I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
Lisa Simpson: You're so silly.
Homer Simpson: Gimme a banana.
Lisa Simpson: I don't have any banana.
Homer Simpson: Come on, you're holding out on me.
Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Think nothing of it.
Homer Simpson: Hey, what's the matter, son?
Bart Simpson: (SHAKING HEAD) Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted...
Homer Simpson: Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Would you have to do extra work?
Bart Simpson: Yeah.
Homer Simpson: And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?
Bart Simpson: Well, no.
Homer Simpson: So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto.
Bart Simpson: (BRIGHTENING) Hey! Thanks, monkey-man.
Homer Simpson: Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
Homer Simpson: Uh oh.
Homer Simpson: Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three.
Marge Simpson: Homie, did you straighten everything out...?
Homer Simpson: (HAPPILY) Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - night)
Homer Simpson: Mmm... hors doovers.
Marge Simpson: Homer! You promised!
Homer Simpson: I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
Marge Simpson: Homer, please. We've never thrown a party. Now we're gonna pay back all the friends who've invited us to their homes.
Lisa Simpson: But Mom, I want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed.
Homer Simpson: (KNOWING CHUCKLE) Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better.
Homer Simpson: Hmmm. (SMACKS HIS LIPS) Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah.
Marge Simpson: (FLUSTERED) Oh! They're here! How does everything look?
Homer Simpson: How do I look?
Marge Simpson: Do we have enough glasses?
Homer Simpson: Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
Marge Simpson: Homer! Homer! Put a record on!
Homer Simpson: What are all our friends names again?
Marge Simpson: Children! Go!
Ned Flanders: Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology. (LAUGHS)
Moe Szyslak: (UNDER BREATH) College boy.
Ned Flanders: Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?
Homer Simpson: Why not? I paid for it.
Homer Simpson: Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?
Ned Flanders: Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor. (LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.
Marge Simpson: Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?
Homer Simpson: No.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson home - a little later)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson HOUSE - LIVING ROOM)
Barney Gumble: Hi! You're Homer's sister-in-law, right? I remember you, but I don't remember you being so beau (BURP) --tiful.
Barney Gumble: Ow! Hey! Jeez! (COUGHING, THEN BURP)
Barney Gumble: (MAKING CONVERSATION) Is that a new kind of Mace? (IMPRESSED) It's really painful.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Uh, no, not really. Someone seems to have slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink.
Homer Simpson: (EXPLODING, LAUGHING) It was me! You fell for it!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Homer, these novelty ice cubes are often made from highly toxic chemicals. Ironically, a real fly would have been much more sanitary.
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Homer Simpson: (OBLIVIOUS, LAUGHING) You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
Homer Simpson: Bart! Come over here.
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?
Bart Simpson: Yes sir.
Homer Simpson: Bart, do that thing you do that's so cute.
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: That thing you know how to do.
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: (LONG BEAT) Go to bed.
Homer Simpson: Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!
Barney Gumble: Oh, Homer, you're the king!
Homer Simpson: I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve.
Husband Of Marge's Friend: Homer, I don't know you. My wife and your wife are friends. We met just three hours ago.
Homer Simpson: (POWERFULLY) You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!
Husband Of Marge's Friend: (CONFUSED) Uh, gee Homer, don't quit...
Homer Simpson: All right then.
Homer Simpson: (HUSKILY) Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude?
Maude Flanders: Oh sure.
Homer Simpson: Not those peanuts. (HOARSELY) The ones at the bottom.
Homer Simpson: (SHUDDERS WITH ECSTASY)
Marge Simpson: (VERY ANNOYED MURMUR)
Barney Gumble: Hey, thanks for invitin' me. I had a wonderful time.
Marge Simpson: I must apologize for my husband.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you roll him onto his side.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm. thank you. I will, Dr. Hibbert. Thanks for coming.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Remember, I said if.
Marge Simpson: I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
Homer Simpson: (GROGGY) Why? What'd you do?
Homer Simpson: Marge!
Marge Simpson: Come here!
Homer Simpson: Where-where are we going?
Marge Simpson: Shhh.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - a little later)
Marge Simpson: I want to make sure the kids don't hear. When I was young, I always hated knowing my parents were fighting.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - foyer window - continuous)
Bart Simpson: They're fighting in the car again.
Lisa Simpson: That music always sends a chill down my spine.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?
Homer Simpson: The way I acted?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Homer Simpson: (CASUAL SOPHISTICATED WHIMSY) So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
Sophisticate #1: Good lord! There's a fly in my drink!
Homer Simpson: (SMILING) I put it there.
Sophisticate #1: (ASTONISHED) You did?
Homer Simpson: I slipped it into your glass as a gag.
Sophisticate #1: (ADMIRINGLY) Pure hilarity!
Sophisticate #2: Pure Homer!
Sophisticate #3: I pronounce it to be the most whimsical jape of the season!
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I like to think that I'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!
Homer Simpson: I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church.
Marge Simpson: I'm going to church alone today. You're going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life.
Homer Simpson: No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bart's room)
Homer Simpson: About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
Bart Simpson: I understand why. You were wasted.
Homer Simpson: I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
Bart Simpson: Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will.
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aw.
(First Church of Springfield: int. church - day)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now before I give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, I have some announcements to make. (LOOKS AT INDEX CARD) We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including "Bible Bafflers", "Satan's Boners," "Good Grief! More Satan's Boners" and, for the teens, "It's Not Cool To Fry In Hell."
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) Marge, Marge.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I'm sorry. The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking of Homer Simpson's shoes. Why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?
Homer Simpson: Sorry, Reverend.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Sit down, Homer.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (LOOKS AT ANOTHER CARD) Mrs. Lovejoy and myself will be holding our third annual marriage retreat next weekend at Catfish Lake. It's psychological counseling for couples whose marriages are hanging by a thread...
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: ... or those just in need of a tune-up.
Homer Simpson: Hmmmm.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now if you wish to participate, please sign up on your way out after the service is over.
(CHURCH FOYER: int. church foyer)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Will the Simpsons be attending our little retreat?
Homer Simpson: (FAKING ENTHUSIASM) Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea.
Homer Simpson: Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!
Marge Simpson: We'll be there!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(Simpson Home: int. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER bedroom - next saturday morning)
Homer Simpson: Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!
Bart Simpson: Now you wanna go?
Homer Simpson: (SLYLY) They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
Marge Simpson: We're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that's all. No fishing.
Marge Simpson: Oh, that must be the babysitter.
Marge Simpson: Hello. I'm Mrs. Simpson.
Sultan: (SOUNDS VAGUELY FAMILIAR) Simpson... Simpson...
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHING DEMONICALLY) Come back for more, eh?
Marge Simpson: Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
Homer Simpson: (FALSE DISMAY) Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth.
Bart Simpson: What do you need a babysitter for? I'm almost ten and a half.
Lisa Simpson: (PROTESTING) Mom! You wouldn't dare.
Bart Simpson: Don't take that tone with me, young lady, or I'll give you a taste of the back of me hand.
Homer Simpson: No, you don't!
Marge Simpson: Grampa?
Grampa Simpson: (STARTLED) Huh... who?... what?
Marge Simpson: Grampa, could you do something?
Grampa Simpson: I can dress myself.
Marge Simpson: Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate.
Grampa Simpson: Oh sure. Last resort... Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. (SIGHS) Everyone's agin me. I'll do it.
Homer Simpson: Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk.
Marge Simpson: Now, if Maggie runs a fever, you call this number. If she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. And if she drinks pine cleanser, call this...
Grampa Simpson: (GRABBING THE LIST) Just give me the list. I can read.
Marge Simpson: All right. All right. Goodbye, children. And behave yourselves.
Marge Simpson: (AN ASIDE) Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub.
Grampa Simpson: I heard that.
Bart Simpson: Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this. It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do.
Grampa Simpson: Uh huh .. (SCANS LIST) Uh-huh... (CONFUSED) You're allowed smoke cigars?
(Mountain Road: ext. mountain road - a half hour later)
Homer Simpson: Hmmm, bait.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car)
Homer Simpson: Whoa, better get some gas.
Homer Simpson: Fill 'er up. (TO MARGE) I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.
(CAFE: int. cafe/souvenir shop/bait shop - few minutes later)
Worm Man: Where ya headed?
Homer Simpson: Catfish Lake.
Worm Man: Oh, after General Sherman, are ya?
Homer Simpson: Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?
Worm Man: He's only the biggest catfish in these parts...
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah.
Worm Man: ... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds.
Homer Simpson: Whoa, who says that?
Worm Man: They do.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Worm Man: Now, that there's the only known picture of the General. Can't see what he is, exactly. He's freakishly big, though.
Homer Simpson: (THINKS) Hmmmm. (ANNOUNCEMENT) Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car)
Bart Simpson: After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty Burger and head for the arcade.
Lisa Simpson: (TO BART) Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?
Bart Simpson: Lis, in these crazy, topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or wrong? But right now my gut's telling me... Bleed Gramps dry.
(RETREAT: ext. retreat)
(Retreat Cabin: int. retreat cabin)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. Welcome!
Marge Simpson: Hello, Reverend. We're glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen.
HELEN: Hel-lo Marge!
Ned Flanders: Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine?
Homer Simpson: None of your business, Flanders.
Homer Simpson: Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer. It takes a whole weekend to do that.
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (PATTING HOMER ON THE SHOULDER) We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage (CHUCKLE) won't be the one that got away.
Homer Simpson: I see. (BEAT) I also understand bowling expressions.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ah, three couples... our best turnout yet. Why don't we go around the room and everyone can introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about why they're here. (TO COUPLE) John... Gloria?
Gloria: My name's Gloria. I'm here because Johnny boy hasn't been able to cut it, manwise, for some time. Not that I'd want his odor of gin and sour defeat pressed against me.
John: That's enough, Gloria!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Thank you, Gloria. John, why don't you tell us a little about why you're here?
John: She never cooks, she keeps a filthy house and she talks profanely. She's the Queen of the Harpies.
Gloria: No, I'm not!
John: Queen of the Harpies!
Gloria: No, I'm not!
John: Here's your crown, your Majesty.
Gloria: Get away from me, swine.
John: Queen of the Harpies!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: You've come to the right place. First, I want you to look into each other's eyes.
John: (GASPS) Your eyes? (DREAMILY) I'd forgotten how beautiful they are.
Gloria: Let's never fight again.
John: We were fools to argue.
Gloria: Let's not talk about that.
John: Let's not talk at all.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Remember my saving your lives and bringing you happiness when we pass the collection plate next week. All right. Ned, Maude, what brings you here?
Ned Flanders: Well...
Maude Flanders: Go on, Neddie.
Ned Flanders: Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers.
Homer Simpson: Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Homer, why are you here?
Homer Simpson: (INTO HIS CHEST) Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress. (POINTS HIS HEAD TOWARDS MAUDE)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: No, no, Homer. Marge is going to tell us all your faults. Why don't you tell us about hers?
Homer Simpson: She's perfect.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Come on, Homer. What are her faults?
Homer Simpson: Well, sometimes that can be annoying.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now, Marge. Don't interrupt. You'll get your turn.
Homer Simpson: I'm done.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Okay. Marge?
Marge Simpson: Well, it's not that I don't love the guy. I'm always sticking up for him. It's just that he's so self-centered.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now, Homer.
Marge Simpson: He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes...
Homer Simpson: (CRYING) It's true. It's all true.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Homer, don't interrupt.
Homer Simpson: Sorry.
Marge Simpson: He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle...
Homer Simpson: I only did that a couple of times.
(Supermarket: int. supermarket)
Lisa Simpson: Half a gallon of chocolate.
Bart Simpson: Check.
Lisa Simpson: Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
Bart Simpson: Check.
Lisa Simpson: Half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip.
Bart Simpson: Check.
Grampa Simpson: Did your Mom really write that shopping list?
Lisa Simpson: Grampa, what a question?
Bart Simpson: What's next, Lis?
Lisa Simpson: Sprinkles and syrup.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Grampa. Aisle six and step on it.
Grampa Simpson: Well, all right, but put out that cigar.
(RETREAT: int. retreat)
Marge Simpson: ... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that's it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That's all I can think of right now. I guess you're all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, we've missed the luau. What say we call it a night?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Captain: I don't want to hear it, McBain. That cannon of yours is against regulations. In this department we go by the book.
Grampa Simpson: You know, kids, it's gettin' pretty late.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. We've had a big day.
Lisa Simpson: It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.
(Dormitory Cabin: int. dormitory cabin - five a.m.)
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. (LAUGHS). The perfect crime.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? I can't believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. You're thinking about fishing, even when I'm talking... right now. Right?
Homer Simpson: Would this be a good time to be honest?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Homer Simpson: You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?
Marge Simpson: Get back in bed.
Homer Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: (UNHAPPY) All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
(Lake: ext. lake - dawn)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.
Homer Simpson: Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!
(Catfish Lake: ext. catfish lake - boat)
Homer Simpson: Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it.
(Simpson Cabin: int. simpson cabin - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Homer?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen)
Grampa Simpson: Sugar?
Lisa Simpson: Yes. Ten please.
Bart Simpson: (SHAKY) Hey Grampa, top me off.
Grampa Simpson: Are you sure your ma lets you kids drink coffee?
Bart Simpson: (EXPLODING) For the last time, yes!
(Catfish Lake: ext. catfish lake - int. row boat - a little later)
Homer Simpson: Good! Give up!
Homer Simpson: (CONFUSED) Huh?
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Bart Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Hey, Milhouse. Big blowout at Casa de Simpson. The only adult is frail and old.
(Van Houten Home: int. milhouse's house)
Milhouse Van Houten: (INTO PHONE) Bart's joint. Uh, twoish. Be there or be square.
(School Bus Garage: int. school bus garage)
Otto Mann: Tell my friends? All right, but I've got some pretty funky friends.
(Jail: int. jail)
Convict: All right! I get out at noon and I'm already invited to a party.
(RETREAT: int. retreat - day)
Helen Lovejoy: Now, this is a trust exercise. You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you.
Marge Simpson: Do I have to do this?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: No. Even if your husband were here, I wouldn't recommend it. Marge, as a trained marriage counselor, this is the first instance where I've ever told one partner that they were 100 percent right. It's all his fault, and I'm willing to put that in a certificate you can frame.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bathroom)
Grampa Simpson: (SINGING) Over there / Send the word / Send the word / Over there.
Grampa Simpson: (SINGING) That the Yanks are comin'...
(Catfish Lake: ext. catfish lake - int. row boat)
Homer Simpson: Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... (SEARCHING) that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show.
Homer Simpson: Whoa! Holy mackerel!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, good to see you, pal. What's happening, man?
Otto Mann: Cherry party, Bart. Any chicks over eight?
Bart Simpson: Not yet, but the afternoon is young.
Bart Simpson: Lisa, what's wrong?
Lisa Simpson: Isn't it obvious? We've degraded ourselves and set back the children's rights movement for decades to come.
Bart Simpson: (SARCASTIC) You're great at a party, Lisa. Really great.
Grampa Simpson: Hey you, no, shut that door! Stop it! Put that away! No, stop, oh!
Grampa Simpson: OW!
Nelson Muntz: Haw haw haw!
Grampa Simpson: You young hellion, do you want me to take off my belt?
Nelson Muntz: Yeah.
Grampa Simpson: All right. I'll show you.
Nelson Muntz: Haw! Haw! Haw!
Grampa Simpson: Doggone it!
(Catfish Lake: ext. catfish lake - int. row boat)
Homer Simpson: (PUNCHING) I love you, but I must kill you.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson HOUSE - living room)
Bart Simpson: Yeah, take care, man. Hey, thanks for coming. (TO NELSON) Hey, nice tie, Nelson..
Nelson Muntz: Ah, thanks, it's your dad's.
Grampa Simpson: (SOBBING) I tried to be a good baby-sitter, but I failed! (SOBS) I'm a feeb... a useless old... worn-out... (CRYING)
Bart Simpson: Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant feeling I've never had before.
Lisa Simpson: It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth.
Bart Simpson: Well, how do you make this feeling go away?
Lisa Simpson: You grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
(Catfish Lake: EXT. CATFISH LAKE - int. row boat)
Homer Simpson: (SINGING) I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!
Homer Simpson: Uh, oh.
Homer Simpson: Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Marge Simpson: (ANGRILY) We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe....
Homer Simpson: Marge, you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero.
Marge Simpson: To who?
Homer Simpson: To those weirdos in the worm store.
Marge Simpson: All this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
Homer Simpson: Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back.
Marge Simpson: Oh yeah, sure.
Homer Simpson: Watch.
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF, AMAZED) Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. (TO MARGE) And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh, Homer.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - a little later)
Homer Simpson: We're back!
Lisa Simpson: How's your marriage?
Homer Simpson: Same as usual. Perfectomundo.
Marge Simpson: Oh my, the house looks wonderful. Grampa, what's your secret?
Grampa Simpson: Pretending to cry. (LAUGHING) That's right, you heard me. Pretending to cry. (CRYING) I can turn it on and off like a fawcet. Boo-hoo, Oh, I'm crying, I'm so sad. (LAUGHING)
Lisa Simpson: Way to go, Grampa.
Bart Simpson: I'll never trust another old person.
Grampa Simpson: I fooled you. So long suckers. Hee hee hee.
(BAIT SHOP: int. bait shop - day)
Worm Man: Yup. General Sherman. They say he's 500 pounds of bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know? No one knows how old he is, but if you ask me, and most people do, he's a hundred years if he's a day.
Customer: And uh, no one's ever caught him?
Worm Man: Well, one fella came close. Went by the name of Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. And his eyes were like steel, cold and hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of hell.
(Simpson Car: INT. SIMPSON CAR - DAY)
Lisa Simpson: Hurry, Mom! If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone.
Bart Simpson: Wow! Number nine! That's before Fallout Boy became his ward.
Bart Simpson: What do you care about good comics? All you ever buy is Casper the Wimpy Ghost.
Lisa Simpson: I think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and I hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity.
Bart Simpson: Well, you know what I think? I think Casper's the ghost of Richie Rich.
Lisa Simpson: Hey, they do look alike!
Bart Simpson: I wonder how Richie died?
Lisa Simpson: Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life.
Marge Simpson: Kids, could you lighten up a little?
Bart Simpson: (TO LISA, HOLDING UP COMIC) Now, Radioactive Man: He rules! Never punches a bad guy without saying something cool.
Lisa Simpson: He's no wittier than the next superhero.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah? Look. (SHOWS COMIC) He knocks a guy into the sun and says, "Hot enough for ya?"
Lisa Simpson: (CHUCKLES) I stand corrected.
Marge Simpson: We're here!
(Springfield Convention Center: ext. springfield convention center - continuous)
(Springfield Convention Center: int. convention center - a minute later)
Lisa Simpson: Too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
Bart Simpson: This looks like a discount for...
Bart Simpson: Bartman!
Ticket Seller: Who are you supposed to be?
Bart Simpson: (À LA MICHAEL KEATON) I'm Bartman!
Ticket Seller: Never heard of him. Full price.
Bart Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Lousy rip off...
DIAMOND JOE: (KENNEDY VOICE) Is uh, this on?... Ahem, young people of Springfield: As your Mayor, I'd like to welcome you to our annual funny book convention, and thank you for pumping almost three hundred dollars into the local economy.
DIAMOND JOE: Your youthful high spirits have imparted a glow to this old war-horse. (JOKING) You might say I feel like Radiation Man!
Jimbo Jones: That's Radioactive Man, jerk!
DIAMOND JOE: I stand corrected... Well, have fun and be sure to clear out by six for the Shriners. (TO ASSISTANT) Get that punk's name. No one makes a fool out of Diamond Joe Quimby.
Martin Prince: Excuse me, sir. Has anyone turned in a left Vulcan ear?
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Lost And Found Guy: (RUMMAGING THROUGH BOX) Let's see, we've got a utility belt, a couple of tricorders, a light saber... Sorry, kid.
Otto Mann: Hey, Bart-dude!
Bart Simpson: Hey, Otto-man! Oooh, what's that?
Otto Mann: My very own idea for a comic book, little man. It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night, fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic warzone!
Bart Simpson: Cool!
Milhouse Van Houten: C'mon, Bart. We're going to see Buddy Hodges.
Bart Simpson: The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV?
Milhouse Van Houten: Yep.
Bart Simpson: Wow, I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam.
Radioactive Man: Aaahh... These Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil.
Fallout Boy: Gee whillikers, Radioactive Man. Wisht I was old enough to smoke Laramies.
Radioactive Man: Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're sixteen.
Radioactive Man: Look out!
Announcer: Will Radioactive Man act in time to save the earth?
Convention Director: Well, wasn't that great?... Y'know, kids, I'm sure we'd all like to remember actor Dirk Richter for his portrayal of Radioactive Man, and not the sordid details of his final years, so let's keep the questions tasteful, okay? Now how about a big welcome for Buddy "Fallout Boy" Hodges!
BUDDY: Any questions?
Milhouse Van Houten: When Radioactive Man got injected with shrinking serum in issue two-thirty-four, how come his costume shrinks, too?
BUDDY: (PURSES LIPS) I am sure I don't know. But I did just finish playing Rum Tum Tugger in the second national touring company of "Cats" -- anybody see it?
Bart Simpson: (RAISING HAND, INTERRUPTING) Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Over here, Fallout Boy! Oh, oh, me... me... me... me, me.
BUDDY: (POINTING TO BART) Yes, you, the masked boy.
Bart Simpson: (EARNESTLY) Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his bullet-riddled body was found?
BUDDY: (UPSET) Dirk Richter was a beautiful man. Can't you little vultures leave him alone?
Nelson Muntz: Hey, Radioactive Man number seventy-two! It's the imaginary tale where Radioactive Man marries Larva Girl.
Dealer: Tell you what. I'll show you something very special if you promise to put your grubby little hands behind your back and keep 'em there.
Dealer: (OPENS PORTFOLIO) Behold!
Bart Simpson: (QUIET AWE) Wow. Radioactive Man Number One.
Dealer: None other.
Bart Simpson: I bet it's worth a million bucks!
Dealer: It is, my lad. But I'll let you have it for a hundred because you remind me of me.
Bart Simpson: (DISMAYED) All I got is thirty.
Dealer: Then you cannot have it.
Bart Simpson: But I must. Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know... to buy that comic book.
Dealer: Your emotion is out of place here, son.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - continuous)
Marge Simpson: So, did you kids have fun?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, Mom! Guess what? For a dollar a man sold me thirty-five Caspers and a dozen Lois Lanes.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh.
Homer Simpson: I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! (GROWLS) And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time. (BARKS) (HOWLS)
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: I was just kidding, Marge. (CHANGING SUBJECT) Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!
Bart Simpson: (KISSING UP) All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger!
Homer Simpson: (SUSPICIOUS) All right, what are you getting at?
Bart Simpson: I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
Homer Simpson: A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?
Bart Simpson: Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world.
Homer Simpson: Well, t.s.
(Krusty Burger: int. krusty burger - a little later)
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.

Homer Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: Please Dad.
Homer Simpson: (SHOUTING) No! (KINDLY) Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.

Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Are you?
Bart Simpson: (AFTER A PAUSE, SCREAMING) Okay.
Homer Simpson: (GLOATING) Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!
Marge Simpson: Don't gloat, Homer. (TO BART) You know, Bart, when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents wouldn't give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma...
(Bouvier House: int. bouvier house - sisters' room - 1963)
Young Patty: (TO MARGE) We'll give you half our allowance.
Young Selma: Uh-huh. But you have to be our slave.
Young Patty: (TO SELMA) This gives us a lot more free time.
Young Selma: Uh-huh. Let's take up smoking.
Marge Simpson: For months, I worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked...
Older Patty: (SINGING ALONG) Venus... Oh, Venus...
Older Selma: (TO MARGE) We want those dress-shields hand-washed and drip-dried.
Nelson Muntz: Haw haw!
Mrs. Glick: Here we are.
Marge Simpson: But the big day finally came. And because I'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good.
(Krusty Burger: int. krusty burger - continuous)
Marge Simpson: So maybe a part-time job is the answer.
Bart Simpson: Aw, Mom, I couldn't ask you to do that. You're already taking care of Maggie, and Lisa is such a handful --
Lisa Simpson: She means you should get a job, stupid.
Bart Simpson: Me?
Adult Narrator: Get a job! Were they serious? I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever.
Homer Simpson: Bart! What are you staring at?
Bart Simpson: Uh... nothing.
Adult Narrator: He didn't say it, and neither did I, but at that moment my dad and I were closer than we ever...
Homer Simpson: Bart! Stop it!
Bart Simpson: Sorry.
(Simpson Home: INT. simpson house - LIVING ROOM - day)
Bart Simpson: (SINGS) "I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY..." AHH
Bart Simpson: Empty bottles... empty bottles...
Bart Simpson: Hm... well, it's practically empty.
(QUIK-E-MART: int. quik-e-mart - later)
Bart Simpson: Here you go, Apu.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Ooh, very good. Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a Jumbo Cherry Squishie?
Bart Simpson: No, not today. I need the dime.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (RINGING IT UP) Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade.
(Simpson Home: INT. simpson house - bart's room)
Bart Simpson: Ah-ha!
(Springfield Bank: int. springfield bank - later)
Bart Simpson: Americanize this, my good man.
Teller: (CHARLES BRONSON VOICE) Okey dokey.
Bart Simpson: All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
Teller: Let the good times roll.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - CURB - AFTERNOON)
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Oh, this is so humiliating... I feel like such a geek.
Lisa Simpson: How's it going, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Terrible. Cars slow down to laugh at me, but no one's buying.
Lisa Simpson: Maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. Lets see...
Lisa Simpson: Ah ha, now you look pathetic.
Bart Simpson: Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Let's see... (CONSIDERS) ... (SEES SOMETHING) Ah!
Bart Simpson: Form a line, no crowding. Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear... Step right up.
Barney Gumble: Ah, Bart could you give me one on credit? I'm a little short this week.
Bart Simpson: Beat it.
Eddie: Say, uh, you got a liquor license there, young fella?
Bart Simpson: (SWAGGERING) Ugh, my dog ate it.
Lou: (WRITING TICKET) Gotta have a license to sell beer.
Bart Simpson: Say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. How about a couple on the house?
Eddie: (CONSIDERS) We-ell, seeing as how it's a first offense...
Lou: I guess we can overlook this.
Bart Simpson: So long, officers. (SEES HOMER) Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Hey, what's all the -- (GASPS)
Homer Simpson: (WEEPING) My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
(Beauty Parlor: int. beauty parlor - next afternoon)
Marge Simpson: The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
Mrs. Glick: A comic book! Oh, my, boys never change. Which one is it, "Nazi Smasher"?
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) I don't think so.
Mrs. Glick: Send him over to my house, I got a few chores he could do. He knows how to mix whitewash, don't he?
(MRS. GLICK'S HOUSE: EXT. MRS. GLICK'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING)
Bart Simpson: (HESITANT) Mrs. Glick?
Mrs. Glick: Eh, you must be Burt Simpson! Well, you look like you've got a strong young back!
Mrs. Glick: Would you like something to eat? I've got dried apricots... almond paste, sauerkraut candy.
Bart Simpson: No, thanks. (POINTS AT PHOTO) Who's that?
Mrs. Glick: Oh, that's my brother, Asa. He was killed in the Great War. Held a grenade too long.
(WORLD WORLD I BATTLEFIELD: ext. WORLD WORLD i battlefield)
Asa: This one's for you Kaiser Bill. Special delivery from Uncle Sam and all the boys in D Company: Yeah! Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob and Reggie. Yeah, even Reggie. He ain't so stuck-up once you get to know...
Mrs. Glick: Here, have some ribbon candy. Boys love candy.
Bart Simpson: No, thanks.
Mrs. Glick: (INSISTENT) Boys love candy.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yes, ma'am!
Bart Simpson: Ugh, I think I'd rather just get to work, Ma'am.
Mrs. Glick: (GRABBING HIM) We'll start with a little light yard work. And when you're done, you can have a nice barley pop.
(GLICK HOUSE: ext. glick house - back yard - continuous)
Mrs. Glick: I want you to clear out all the weeds. You do know which ones are weeds?
Bart Simpson: All of 'em?
Mrs. Glick: Good boy.
Mrs. Glick: Now be careful with these. I'll be inside watching my stories.
Bart Simpson: Ow!. . .Ow!
Soap Actress: (FROM TV) Jack, please. I'm married.
Soap Actor: (FROM TV) That must be what's turning me on.
Soap Actress: Oh... Stop it... some more.
Mrs. Glick: Filthy, but genuinely arousing.
Bart Simpson: Finished.
Mrs. Glick: Merciful heavens, you're bleeding! (EXITING) I'll get the iodine.
Mrs. Glick: Now, don't fidget.
Bart Simpson: Listen, lady, you don't have to -- YAAAUUUUGGGHHH!
Mrs. Glick: (OVER SCREAM) They've never improved on iodine.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - later afternoon)
Bart Simpson: Hi, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Did you make any money?
Bart Simpson: Not yet, but at least I'm in a lot of pain.
Marge Simpson: Well, I think what you're doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn't have anybody.
Bart Simpson: There's a reason.
Mrs. Glick: (CHEERFUL) The sludge certainly collects around those downspouts, don't it?
Bart Simpson: (MUTTERING UNDER HIS BREATH) I'll sludge you, you old bat.
Mrs. Glick: Today, we wash Beulah. Do you know what that is?
Bart Simpson: Some old lady thing, nobody's heard about for fifty years?
Mrs. Glick: No, it was my wedding dress, but then I dyed it black and it became my mourning dress.
Bart Simpson: Great story, lady.
Bart Simpson: Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms.
Bart Simpson: No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH!
(GLICK HOUSE: int. glick house - foyer)
Mrs. Glick: Well, it's payday. I'll wager you've been looking forward to this.
Chimp: (HAPPY CHIMP NOISE)
Mrs. Glick: Two quarters.
Bart Simpson: Two quarters?
Mrs. Glick: You deserve every penny. You know, I've told a lot of my girlfriends about you and they have chores too.
Bart Simpson: Two quarters!
Mrs. Glick: Bart, you didn't say thank you.
Bart Simpson: Listen lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can leave without saying a bad word, but there's no way that I am saying thank you.
Mrs. Glick: You're welcome. All right then, off you go, to spend it on penny whistles and moon pies.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER)
Bart Simpson: (GRUMBLING) Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her...
Homer Simpson: What's the problem, boy?
Bart Simpson: I've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents.
Homer Simpson: Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.
Bart Simpson: (SKEPTICAL) Really?
Homer Simpson: (PAUSE) Nah.
Bart Simpson: Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps.
Homer Simpson: Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out.
(The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop: ext. the android's dungeon and baseball card shop - day)
Martin Prince: Can you let me have it for forty dollars?
Dealer: Forty bucks? Forget it! You made me get off my stool for that?
Martin Prince: It's all I've got. I sold seeds. I visited my aunt in the nursing home. I fished a dime out of the sewer, for God's sake!
Dealer: No way. (TO BART) What do you want?
Bart Simpson: Can I have it for thirty-five?
Dealer: No!... No!... Freakin' kids. I do not need this, I've got a Masters degree in folklore and mythology.
Milhouse Van Houten: Excuse me, do you have the Carl Yastrzemski baseball card from 1973, when he had big sideburns?
Dealer: Show me the thirty bucks, because if you ain't got it, I ain't gettin' off the stool.
Bart Simpson: Wait a minute, Martin. If you, Milhouse and I went in together, we could buy a copy of "Radioactive Man No. 1" right now!
Martin Prince: Wow!
Dealer: Here you go. "Muttonchop Yaz."
Milhouse Van Houten: I don't want it.
Dealer: Freakin' kids!
Bart Simpson: Look, pal. We've got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy "Radioactive Man No. 1". So why don't you just waddle over there and get it.
Dealer: (IMPRESSED) Yes sir.
Bart Simpson: Wow! Breathe it in, boys!
Martin Prince: This is the stuff dreams are made of.
Milhouse Van Houten: It smells like my grandpa.
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home.
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh.
Dealer: Looks like you bought more than you bargained for.
(Bart's Treehouse: int. tree house - a little later)
Radioactive Man: My pants... caught on barbed wire... Good Lord Choke... an A-bomb!
Radioactive Man: Yaarrgh!
Radioactive Man: I'm becoming radioactive. From this day forward, I shall call myself Radioactive Man.
Milhouse Van Houten: (HUSHED) So that's how it happened!
Martin Prince: I would've thought being hit by an atomic bomb would have killed him.
Bart Simpson: Now you know better.
Milhouse Van Houten: Turn the page, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Listen, you guys are welcome to come over and read it any time you like.
Milhouse Van Houten: Why can't we keep it at my house?
Bart Simpson: Your house? That's crazy talk!
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, the comic's ours as much as it is yours.
Martin Prince: How about this, guys. Bart can have it Mondays and Thursdays. Milhouse will get it Tuesdays and Fridays. And yours truly will take it Wednesdays and Saturdays.
Bart Simpson: Perfect.
Milhouse Van Houten: Wait a minute. What about Sunday?
Bart Simpson: Yeah. What about Sunday?
Martin Prince: Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number generator. I will take the digits one through three. Milhouse will have four through six. And Bart will have seven through nine.
Bart Simpson: Perfect.
Milhouse Van Houten: Wait a minute. What about zero?
Bart Simpson: Yeah! What about zero?
Milhouse Van Houten: Yeah.
Martin Prince: Well, in the unlikely event of a zero, possession will be determined by "Rock, Scissor, Paper" competition. Best three out of five, how's that?
Martin Prince: Excellent! Well, today being Saturday, Gentlemen, I guess I'll be taking my comic and...
Bart Simpson: (MENACINGLY) Uh, uh, uh, ah nice try, Martin. It almost worked. But tonight, this comic book stays right here.
Martin Prince: If the comic book stays right here, then so do I.
Milhouse Van Houten: Me too!
Bart Simpson: Fine. We're all going to stay here with the comic book. It'll be like a sleep-over. Yeah, a sleep-over. That's what pals do, right? Real friendly-like.
Milhouse Van Houten: I want to read it again.
Bart Simpson: Nice try, mister.
Martin Prince: Milhouse, the acids in your hands could damage the newsprint. We want to keep this comic forever, so the last one alive will have the honor of being buried with it.
Bart Simpson: (SUSPICIOUSLY) What do you mean, the last one alive?
Martin Prince: I meant years from now.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, sure you did.
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, don't push him!
Bart Simpson: I knew it. You're both against me! Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholemew J. Simpson.
Marge Simpson: I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
Milhouse Van Houten: (GASPING FOR AIR) Thank you, Mrs. Simpson.
Bart Simpson: Sweet dreams, boys.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - back yard - night)
(Bart's Treehouse: int. tree house - late at night)
Bart Simpson: One more step and you're a dead man.
Martin Prince: I have to go to the bathroom, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, right, so do I, but you don't see me gettin' up.
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey, what's going on?
Bart Simpson: Our dear friend Martin was trying to steal the comic book.
Milhouse Van Houten: Let's tie him up!
Martin Prince: Bart, is this how you treat all your guests?
Bart Simpson: Hmp, impressive.
Bart Simpson: Quiet, Piggy, or we'll stick an apple in your mouth. (TO MILHOUSE) We can't take any chances. We'll have to take turns watching him.
Milhouse Van Houten: Okay. I'll go first.
Bart Simpson: Oh, so that's your little game. Let old Bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!
Bart Simpson: Well, it is not going to happen, see?
Milhouse Van Houten: You're going crazy, Bart. I'm telling your mom!
Bart Simpson: Hey Martin, tell him what we do with squealers.
Martin Prince: I don't know. Is it worse than what you do with people that have to go to the bathroom?
Milhouse Van Houten: (TO BART) You can't stop me.
Bart Simpson: The hell I can't!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Marge Simpson: Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?
Homer Simpson: They're fine.
(Bart's Treehouse: int. tree house - continuous)
Martin Prince: Bart, the comic!
Milhouse Van Houten: Don't let go of me Bart!
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, it's not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit.
Milhouse Van Houten: No, Bart! No!
Martin Prince: (SMUGLY) You know, if you guys hadn't tied me up, I could be saving the comic as we speak.
Bart Simpson: Shut up! Shut up!
Milhouse Van Houten: Help me, Bart! I didn't even want the comic. I wanted Carl Yastrzemski with the big side-burns.
Marge Simpson: Boys, you better come in the house. You don't want to get the sniffles.
Bart Simpson: Aw, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Now come on... (LOOKING AT MARTIN) You can play your little tie-up game inside. I've got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows?
Martin Prince: I'd raise my hand, Mrs. Simpson, if I could.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - the next morning)
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Martin Prince: (SAD) It's no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came.
Bart Simpson: We worked so hard and now it's all gone... We ended up with nothing because the three of us can't share.
Milhouse Van Houten: What's your point?
Bart Simpson: Nothing. It just kind of ticks me off.
Radioactive Man: Well, the world is safe again... but for how long?
(HILL NEAR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT: ext. hill near nuclear power plant - morning)
Mayor Joe Quimby: Ah, Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests. I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. In the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of Springfield, what to do.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign. (LAUGH)
Mayor Joe Quimby: And now, I would like to present the man who made this sign possible, by dropping the last of his obstructionist legal challenges... Montgomery Burns.
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns is never late. Something must be terribly wrong.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Well, there better be. Nobody leaves Diamond Joe Quimby holding the bag!
(Burns Manor: int. burns mansion - master bedroom - morning)
C. Montgomery Burns: (GRUNTING) Must... turn... over. Got to... greet... dignitaries!
Waylon Smithers: Oh, no, Mr. Burns! We've got to get a doctor!
C. Montgomery Burns: Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me! As long as there's an ounce of strength left in me, I...
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Mmmm. Mr. Burns is suffering from what we medical men call hypohemia. In layman's terms it's quite simply a lack of blood.
Waylon Smithers: (ANXIOUSLY) Damn it, doctor, I'm no idiot! I know what hypohemia is. What I want to know is what can we do about it?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, at this point, our only hope is a transfusion.
Waylon Smithers: How long does it take to sterilize a needle?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: A few seconds.
Waylon Smithers: Well, skip it.
Waylon Smithers: Just leave me enough to get home.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (CHUCKLING) I'm afraid it's not that simple. His blood type is Double-O-Negative. It's quite rare.
Waylon Smithers: (ANGUISHED MOAN) But I'm B positive. Damn this common gutter blood in my veins!
C. Montgomery Burns: (WEAKLY) Smithers, don't feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. nuclear power plant - afternoon)
Homer Simpson: How many hairs on my head? Without looking!
Waylon Smithers: (BRAVELY) Go ahead.
Chimp: (PLEASED GRUNTING)
Waylon Smithers: (OVER P.A. - DISTRAUGHT) Attention all employees. Our boss and inspiration, Mr. Burns... is at death (CHOKES UP)... death's door. If you have type Double-O-Negative blood, I implore you to report to the Bloodmobile outside. That is all.
Carl Carlson: I'd give him my blood, except for one thing.
Lenny Leonard: What's that?
Carl Carlson: I don't wanna. (LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: (INCREDULOUS) I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job.
Carl Carlson: You know, Homer, I am your supervisor.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, sir.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - evening)
Lisa Simpson: Maggie, look. What's that?
Lisa Simpson: Lee-mur. Lee-mur.
Lisa Simpson: Zee-boo. Zee-boo.
Marge Simpson: What are you doing, honey?
Lisa Simpson: I'm trying to teach Maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. I want her to have all the advantages that I didn't have.
Marge Simpson: (OFFENDED) Lisa, we did the best we could... What's a zebu?
Lisa Simpson: It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. (SINGSONG TO MAGGIE) Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap.
Homer Simpson: Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?
Marge Simpson: A-Positive.
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it.
Lisa Simpson: You know his blood type, how romantic.
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR) A mother knows everything about her family.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, yeah? What's my shoe size?
Marge Simpson: Four B.
Bart Simpson: How many teeth do I have?
Marge Simpson: Sixteen permanent, eight baby.
Homer Simpson: Earmuffs.
Marge Simpson: XL.
Lisa Simpson: Ring.
Marge Simpson: I don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three.
Bart Simpson: Allergies.
Marge Simpson: Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.
Bart Simpson: And?
Marge Simpson: Glow in the dark monster make-up.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type?
Homer Simpson: Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it.
Marge Simpson: Bart does.
Homer Simpson: (ECSTATIC) Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!
Bart Simpson: Hey, wait a minute. I don't have to give blood. I have rights, you know.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, you have the right to remain silent.
Marge Simpson: Bart, you have to help someone in need. It's the only decent thing to do.
Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer Simpson: Bart, it's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. Don't you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?
Bart Simpson: Is it a Bible story?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches.
Bart Simpson: How did a lion get rich?
Homer Simpson: It was the olden days!
Bart Simpson: Oh.
(Bloodmobile: ext. bloodmobile - next morning)
Homer Simpson: (KNOCKING) Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!
Otto Mann: Just a sec, man!
(BACK OF BLOODMOBILE: ext. back of bloodmobile - continuous)
Bart Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Whoa, Otto-man! You work here?
Otto Mann: Oh yeah! During the day, all my friends are in school, so I got a job as a Certified Bloodletting Tech Dude.
Homer Simpson: Now let's get the show on the road.
Otto Mann: Okay. Let me wash up.
Waylon Smithers: Homer, brave young Bart. I don't know which one to hug first.
Homer Simpson: Eh.... the boy.
(Hospital: Ext. hospital - day)
Dr. Julius Hibbert: We're ready with the transfusion.
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, I'm not going to make it. I want to dictate... my epitaph.
C. Montgomery Burns: "Charles... Montgomery... Burns." (BEAT)
Waylon Smithers: Um, hmm.
C. Montgomery Burns: "American Patriot"
C. Montgomery Burns: "... American Patriot."
C. Montgomery Burns: (STRONGER) "Master Of The Atom."
C. Montgomery Burns: (STRONGER) "Scourge Of The Despot."
C. Montgomery Burns: (BOOMING) "O Tyrant Hear His Mighty Name And QUAKE!!" Smithers, I'm back!
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - NEXT MORNING)
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, top o' the mornin' to ye! Why, look who's here! It's good old... you!
Smitty: (PUZZLED) Hi, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SEES LENNY) (CHUCKLES) Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm?
Homer Simpson: (AMAZED) Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!
(Burns's Private Fronton: int. burns' private fronton - later)
Osvaldo: Aye, caramba!
C. Montgomery Burns: Heh-heh-heh! Well, that's game! Hasta manana, Osvaldo!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, I'm back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar!
Waylon Smithers: Just remarkable, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad's name?
Waylon Smithers: Uh, Bart Simpson, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Who?
Waylon Smithers: He's the son of Homer Simpson. One of your stiffs in Sector 7-G.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed. (LAUGH)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - evening)
Homer Simpson: Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... (GASPS) (SEES RETURN ADDRESS) Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!
Homer Simpson: Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
Homer Simpson: Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!
Lisa Simpson: Yes, Dad.
Homer Simpson: It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check.
Marge Simpson: The meaning of what?
Homer Simpson: "Better half," Marge. "Better half."
(Radio Station: ext. radio station - night)
Homer Simpson: All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. (READS) "Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns." (ANNOYED GRUNT) It's just a card!
Homer Simpson: This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. (FURIOUS) That's what got me so mad in the first place.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in (FAIRY VOICE) a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats...
Bart Simpson: Yeah, Mom. We got hosed!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: (FIRMLY) We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance.
Homer Simpson: I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter.
Homer Simpson: (DICTATING) "Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!" Could you read that last part back to me?
Bart Simpson: (MATTER OF FACTLY) "You stink."
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Good. "You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."
Bart Simpson: An elephant's butt?
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) "An elephant's butt."
(Sidewalk: ext. sidewalk - night)
Marge Simpson: But he's your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute?
Homer Simpson: Yup!
Marge Simpson: You're still angry, Homer. Why don't you sleep on it?
Homer Simpson: Forget it, Marge!
Marge Simpson: Please, Homie? For me?
Homer Simpson: (SOFTENING) Oh, all right. (GRUMBLING) You always do that hand thing! And it usually works.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Homer Simpson: Cheap son-of-a...
Marge Simpson: Homer... Breakfast is ready.
Homer Simpson: (IN HIS SLEEP) Hmmm...
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of (TAKING ANOTHER BITE) mmphm hnmph.
Marge Simpson: Oh... thank you.
Homer Simpson: (LOOKS AROUND) Where's the letter?
(CORNER MAILBOX: ext. corner mailbox - morning)
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING)
Homer Simpson: (PANICKED) Where is it? (GROAN)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I don't think it's in the cornstarch canister.
Homer Simpson: (FRANTIC) Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!
Homer Simpson: Bart, have you seen the letter?
Bart Simpson: Yup.
Homer Simpson: All right, (SLOWLY) think very carefully. Where did you see it last?
Bart Simpson: (IMITATING HOMER, SLOWLY) The last place I saw it...
Homer Simpson: Uh huh.
Bart Simpson: ...was in my hand...
Homer Simpson: Yeah...
Bart Simpson: ...as I was shoving it into the mailbox.
Homer Simpson: (PAINED GRUNT) Why did you do that?
Bart Simpson: Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You're an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. So I...
Homer Simpson: I'll show you mad in the morning.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself.
Homer Simpson: (STARTS CRYING) She's right. (TO HIMSELF) Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!
(Street: ext. street - corner mailbox - day)
Homer Simpson: (REACHING AROUND) Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Bart Simpson: Give it up, Homer. It's locked up tight.
Homer Simpson: (SLYLY) Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy.
Barney Gumble: (YELLING) Hey, I'm with you, Homer. (WITH RAISED FIST) Fight the power!
Bart Simpson: Why the hose, Homer?
Homer Simpson: What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?
Homer Simpson: So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: "Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo." Big loss.
Homer Simpson: Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal.
Bart Simpson: Dad, the mailman is here.
Homer Simpson: That's a good one. We'll use that.
Bart Simpson: No, I mean the mailman's here.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMS)
Mail Person: (SEEING HOSE) Dear God! Are you planning to water the mail?
Homer Simpson: Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?
Mail Person: (MALICIOUSLY) That's right.
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm still gonna run!
(Burns Manor: int. burns' mansion - parlor - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia.
Waylon Smithers: Well, sir, Mr. Roman is one of the finest ghostwriters in the business.
Waylon Smithers: He's written "Like Hell I Can't!"... "Up From The Muck"... and "The Unsinkable Sadruddin Mahbaradad!"
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent.
Roman: All right, all right. First question? Have you slept with anyone famous?
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... (GASP) What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I'm not some dizzy starlet who can't string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You're fired.
(Post Office: int. post office - day)
Homer Simpson: (TO POSTAL WORKER; FAKE VOICE) Hello, my name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.
Postal Worker: Okay, Mr. Burns. What's your first name?
Homer Simpson: (CONFIDENT) I don't know.
Homer Simpson: (SOUR) Great plan, Bart.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - day)

Homer Simpson: Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take.
C. Montgomery Burns: Can I help you?
Bart Simpson: (SAD) They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it.
C. Montgomery Burns: (NOTICING) Oh, don't be frightened of this. It's nothing but a letter opener. Who are you?
Homer Simpson: Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, eh? Simpson. (LOOKS AT LETTERS) Oh, why, there's a letter here from you. I'll just read it right now. (READS) "Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your card was just great." (CHUCKLES; TO HOMER) Why, Simpson. You've made my day. You're a true gentleman.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) Yeah, well I'll be on my --
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello, there's more. (CONTINUES READING, DRIPPING WITH SARCASM) "In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic..."
C. Montgomery Burns: (READING) "...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed..." (WITH GROWING ANGER) "...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!"
Homer Simpson: Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?
Joey: (ANNOYED) Homer, I don't tell you how to do your job. Okay?
C. Montgomery Burns: I could crush him like an ant, but it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until... Oh, what the hell. I'll just crush him like an ant.
(Burns Manor: INT. BURNS MANSION - NIGHT)
C. Montgomery Burns: "Senile," eh? "Buck-toothed," am I? "Bony arms," are they? "Liver spots," did I? "Chinless," will you?
Waylon Smithers: His pink slip awaits your signature, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now, that's odd. I've just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers. Have him beaten to a pulp.
Waylon Smithers: But, sir --
C. Montgomery Burns: (THRU HIS TEETH) But what?
Waylon Smithers: Nothing, sir.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - kitchen - night)
Homer Simpson: Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad.
Marge Simpson: (SYMPATHETIC MOAN)
Homer Simpson: Me and my big... letter writing pen!
Marge Simpson: Honey, what's done is done. No matter what happens, we'll pull through. We always do.
Homer Simpson: Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Lisa Simpson: (COMFORTING) That's okay, Bart. Nobody really believed it. We were just trying to scare you.
(SMITHERS' OFFICE: int. smithers' office - day)

(Burns's Study: int. burns' study - night)
C. Montgomery Burns: In closing, gentle reader, I'd like to thank you. What's that you say? Me thanking you? No, it's not a misprint. For you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The end.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHEERILY) Ah Smithers, how'd the beating go?
Waylon Smithers: Sir, uh... there was no beating.
C. Montgomery Burns: What? Well that's a hell of a thing! Why?
Waylon Smithers: Because... I... I called it off.
C. Montgomery Burns: Judas!
Waylon Smithers: I'm sorry, sir. But I just couldn't hurt Homer Simpson. He saved your life.
C. Montgomery Burns: I see.
Waylon Smithers: I know you're mad at me, but I think it's only fair to warn you, I'm going to stand outside the gate until you forgive me.
C. Montgomery Burns: No need, Smithers. As usual, you've been the sober "ying" to my raging "yang." Put 'er there, old pal.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, while I wish this handshake would never end, I'm, I'm afraid we still have the Simpson matter to attend to.
C. Montgomery Burns: We do indeed, old friend. We do indeed.

Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick.
Moe Szyslak: What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.
Homer Simpson: I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one.

Lisa Simpson: Wait, Dad, he's smiling.
Homer Simpson: Mr. Burns, you brought us a present.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why, what did you think I was going to do -- have you beaten to a bloody pulp?
C. Montgomery Burns: To show there's no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, "Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?" (TO BART) And now, young fellow, I haven't forgotten you. Here.
Bart Simpson: (DELIGHTED) Wow! A crowbar!
Lisa Simpson: It's to open the crate, stupid.
Homer Simpson: (ASIDE TO MARGE) What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls...
Bart Simpson: (SURPRISED) Wow! A big ugly head!
C. Montgomery Burns: (AMUSED) Actually, son, it's a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt'tapalatakettle, the god of war.
Bart Simpson: Awesome!
Lisa Simpson: (SWEETLY) No, Maggie. Not Az-tec. Ol-mec. Ol-mec.
Homer Simpson: Marge, what does it do?
Marge Simpson: It doesn't do anything.
Homer Simpson: (IRRITATED) Marge! Really, what does it do?
Marge Simpson: Whatever it does, it's doing it now.
C. Montgomery Burns: (PLEASED) Well, I'll let you get acquainted with Señor Xt'tapalatakettle. Ta!
C. Montgomery Burns: Did you see their faces, Smithers?
Waylon Smithers: Sir, you're my god of generosity.
Homer Simpson: (BITTERLY) Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock.
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head.
Marge Simpson: Homer, it's the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, "A good deed is its own reward."
Bart Simpson: Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool!
Marge Simpson: Well then, I guess the moral is, "No good deed goes unrewarded."
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!
Marge Simpson: Well... then I guess the moral is, "The squeaky wheel gets the grease."
Lisa Simpson: Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
Homer Simpson: Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
Marge Simpson: But it certainly was a memorable few days!
Homer Simpson: Amen to that!

Bart Simpson: Well, what do you know? I'm relieved.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, my birthday is in two days. I'm gonna be eight years old. It's a big number -- almost double digits.
Bart Simpson: Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore --
Bart Simpson: Lisa did it.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?
Bart Simpson: Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he?
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I've made things for you. But you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all...
Bart Simpson: (OVERLAPPING) Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! I'm doing it! Birthday gift coming your way!

Bart Simpson: (FROM BEHIND THE BOX) Can do.
Bart Simpson: Hm... Krusty hotline.
Krusty the Clown: Hi kids! You've reached the Krusty Hotline. If you haven't asked your parents' permission, naughty naughty! But Krusty forgives you! Two dollars for the first minute, fifty cents for each additional minute. (LONG LAUGH THAT DOESN'T STOP)
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS, THEN) Thanks for calling kids! A new message every day.
Marge Simpson: (SHOCKED) Maggie!
Marge Simpson: Bart, I asked you to watch your sister!
Bart Simpson: I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
Homer Simpson: (PANICKY) Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?
Marge Simpson: I washed it.
Homer Simpson: (WARMLY) Oh thank you, Marge -- (SHRIEKS) Pink?
Homer Simpson: (SCARED) Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different.
Marge Simpson: Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts.
Homer Simpson: Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
Homer Simpson: (FRANTIC) Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! (SOBBING) It's all over, Marge. It's all over.
Marge Simpson: I don't know how this could have happened.
Bart Simpson: Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!
Homer Simpson: You! You did this to me!
Marge Simpson: Homer, please. No one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. nuclear power plant - morning)
C. Montgomery Burns: Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink?
Waylon Smithers: Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir. He's one of your boobs from Sector 7-G.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort of free-thinking anarchist.
Waylon Smithers: I'll call security, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. These color monitors have already paid for themselves.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - corridor)
Lenny Leonard: Hey Homer, we saved you a doughnut.
Carl Carlson: It has pink frosting!
Homer Simpson: Mmm, thanks -- It looks... (CATCHING ON) Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! (LICKING LIPS) Although it is tempting --
Guard #1: (SHARPLY) Drop that doughnut.
Guard #2: Let's go, Pinky.
Homer Simpson: (WHIMPERING) You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
C. Montgomery Burns: Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away!
Waylon Smithers: You know, Mr. Burns, his body cavity search revealed nothing and we must have x-rayed him a hundred times. Maybe he's telling the truth.
C. Montgomery Burns: Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in '79.
Waylon Smithers: Uh, sir, that was my costume from the plant production of H.M.S. Pinafore.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. (RE HOMER) Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. That's all changed, thanks to the "Marvin Monroe Take Home Personality Test." Twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or (AIR QUOTES) meshuggenah, someone is.

Homer Simpson: I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons.
Michael: I can't believe you've never heard of me. I'm a very popular entertainer.

Michael: (LAUGHING) Hee hee hee...
Michael: You seem like a nice guy. Why'd they put you in here?

Bart Simpson: (SKEPTICAL) Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you?
Michael: He could be. It's a big hospital.
Bart Simpson: Aw, come on. If you're really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys?
Michael: Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles.
Bart Simpson: Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives?

Psychiatrist: Mrs. Simpson, I'm sorry but your husband suffers from a persecution complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility.

Bart Simpson: Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?
Homer Simpson: Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend.
Marge Simpson: That's the problem. Even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves.

Homer Simpson: Why not?
Ned Flanders: I sold it to you for seven cents.
Homer Simpson: Oh.

Fat Tony: And what if your family don't like bread, they like cigarettes?
Bart Simpson: I guess that's okay.
Fat Tony: Now, what if instead of giving them away, you sold them at a price that was practically giving them away. Would that be a crime, Bart?

C. Montgomery Burns: Yeah. so, what did you do this weekend, Smithers?
Waylon Smithers: Well, I caught up on my laundry. And wrote a letter to mother. Oh, here's the kicker, I took Hercules out to be clipped.
C. Montgomery Burns: Who the devil is Hercules?
Waylon Smithers: He's my Yorkshire terrier, sir. He's kind of tiny, so... you know, it's a joke. Here's a picture of Herkie.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SARCASTIC) Well, Smithers, don't you know how to paint the town red.
Waylon Smithers: May I ask how you spent your weekend?
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, a bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird.
C. Montgomery Burns: Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time.
Homer Simpson: What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets. (PIG SNORTS)

Marge Simpson: Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things...
Luann Van Houten: Well, Marge, the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf sucks. He must have gotten that from your little boy, because they certainly don't say that word on TV!
Marge Simpson: Well, I can't defend everything he does. But let's face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They're too young for girls. And they're a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they're always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends!
Barney Gumble: So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me!

Homer Simpson: (SOBS) What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Barney Gumble: Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.

Krusty the Clown: Well, okay. First of all, my real name isn't Krusty the Clown, it's Hershel Krustofsky. My father was a rabbi. His father was a rabbi. His father's father -- well, you get the idea.
(Lower East Side of Springfield: ext. lower east side of Springfield - day)
Krusty the Clown: My father was the most respected man in the lower east side of Springfield. People would come from miles around to ask his advice.
Man #1: Reb Krustofsky, should I finish college?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Yes. No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge.
Woman: Rabbi, should I have another child?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Yes, another child would be a blessing on your house.
Man #2: Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Could you rephrase that as a, as a ethical question?
Man #2: (Struggling) Hmm... is it right to buy a Chrysler?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (MAKING A PRONOUNCEMENT) Yes, for great is the car with power steering and dyna-flow suspension.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson's house - at that moment)
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Hershel, life is not fun. Life is serious. Seltzer is for drinking, not for spraying. Pie is for noshing, not for throwing.
Krusty the Clown: But papa, can't...
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (INTERRUPTING) But nothing! You'll do as I say or you'll get such a zetz that you won't even know what hit you.
(Yeshiva Classroom: int. yeshiva classroom - day)
Krusty the Clown: Dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but the pull of clowning was too strong. I got my first big laughs at Yeshiva impersonating my father.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - DINING ROOM - night)
Homer Simpson: Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.
Bart Simpson: Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you.
Homer Simpson: Why you little...
Lisa Simpson: Krusty, please continue.
Krusty the Clown: Okay.
(Krustofsky Home: Int. KRUSTOFSKY home - evening)
Krusty the Clown: My father tried to extinguish the comedy bug. But it was no use.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: What are you doing in that bathroom?
Krusty the Clown: Go away.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Open the door this instant.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Oy gevalt!
Krusty the Clown: Close the door!
(GROSSINGERS: Int. grossingers - on stage - night)
Krusty the Clown: Then came my big break. A Talmudic conference in the Catskills and I was the entertainment.
Krusty the Clown: But the Lord works in mysterious ways.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Do you know that my son Hershel was first in his Yeshiva class. As a matter of fact, he was voted "The Most Likely to Hear God."
Rabbi #1: Oh go on, Hymie. You're exaggerating again. You're so proud of your son.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: A rabbi would never exaggerate. A rabbi composes; he creates thoughts; he tells stories that may never have happened, but he does not exaggerate.
Krusty the Clown: My father would have never have suspected a thing, were it not for one rowdy rabbi.
Rowdy Rabbi: Hey, Funny-man!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Hershel? Hershel! Oy vay iz mir!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (GRAVELY) I have no son!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: You have brought shame on our family. Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive. But, but-but this? I never want to see you again. You... you... clown!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - DINING ROOM - night)
Krusty the Clown: (PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER) And I haven't seen my father since.
Lisa Simpson: That is so sad.
Bart Simpson: Krusty, do you think about your father a lot?
Krusty the Clown: All the time. Except when I'm at the track. Then it's all business.
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS) Look at you, Bart.
Krusty the Clown: Oh, isn't that fun?
Krusty the Clown: Hey, whoa.
Krusty the Clown: Oh, the Fourth of July. I can't believe that little boy in the pictures is you, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, I've got a lot of fond memories.
Marge Simpson: Well, look at the time. Almost midnight.
Krusty the Clown: Do you have any yearbooks?
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED) No, that's it. You've seen everything.
Krusty the Clown: (CHANGING THE SUBJECT) So uh, Milhouse, know any knock-knock jokes?
Milhouse Van Houten: (CRYING) I want to go home.
Marge Simpson: Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home.
Homer Simpson: Gladly.
Krusty the Clown: Wow. The Concert For Bangladesh.
Bart Simpson: Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad.
Krusty the Clown: Don't worry about me, I'm a survivor.
Krusty the Clown: Hey, did I leave my keys inside?
Bart Simpson: No!

Krusty the Clown: (EMOTIONAL) Didn't Itchy Jr. look happy playing with his father? And didn't Scratchy Jr. look happy playing with his dad until they got run over by a thresher? Wasn't that a beautiful cartoon? (SOBBING) For the love of God, cut to a commercial.
Bart Simpson: Poor Krusty.
Lisa Simpson: A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
Bart Simpson: We've got to do something.
Lisa Simpson: (SERIOUS) Let's move.
(Rev. Lovejoy's Office: int. rev. lovejoy's office)
Bart Simpson: Reverend Lovejoy, we need you to help us find a rabbi.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (TAKEN ABACK) Well, um... before you make any rash decisions, let me just remind you that the church is changing to meet the needs of today's young Christians.
Lisa Simpson: No, no. We're not converting, we just want to find a Rabbi Krustofsky.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Rabbi Krustofsky? Why, I do a radio call-in show with him every Sunday night.
Bart Simpson: Really?
Lisa Simpson: I didn't know that.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Gee, I mention it in my sermon every week.
Bart Simpson: Oh, oh, that radio show.
Lisa Simpson: (COVERING) Oh yeah, it's all the kids talk about on Monday at school.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Oh, well. Why have a free T-shirt. You'll be the "coolest" kids on the playground.
Bart Simpson: We'll put them on later. Now can you give us the rabbi's address?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Oh sure thing. Let me just check my "Non-Christian" rolodex.

Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Oh, what can I do for you, my young friends?
Bart Simpson: We came to talk to you about your son.
D.J.: And in order to keep our broadcasting license, we devote Sunday night dead time to public service shows of limited appeal.
D.J.: In that spirit, we bring you "Gabbin' about God," sponsored by Ace Religion Supply where they say: "If we don't got it, it ain't holy."
D.J.: With us tonight, once again, our very own three wise men: Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Monsignor Kenneth Daley, and Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky.
D.J.: Okay, and our first caller is from Shelbyville Heights.
Caller: Yes, hi, with all the suffering and injustice in the world, do you ever wonder if God really exists?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: No.
MONSIGNOR DALEY: (IRISH BROGUE) Not for a second.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Not at all.

Bart Simpson: (OVER THE PHONE) Hello, my name's Dimitri. I'm a first time caller, long time listener.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - continuous)
Bart Simpson: My question is, "If a son defies his father, and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy, shouldn't the father forgive the son?"
(Radio Station: int. radio station - continuous)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I think so.
MONSIGNOR DALEY: Yes, of course.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (GOING CRAZY) No way. Absolutely not. Never! Never! Who screens these calls? Who's in charge here? There's nobody in charge. They leave a building without people watching it and anybody who wants can call any stupid person they please...
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - continuous)
Bart Simpson: (DETERMINED) Don't worry, Lis. I've got a plan that can't fail.

(Park: ext. park - day)
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Oh, the best charity is to give and not let other people know.
Rabbi #2: But what if your example encourages others to give?
Bart Simpson: Speaking of charity, Rabbi Krustofsky, don't you think it's time you forgave your son?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Don't you understand that my boy broke my heart? He turned his back on our traditions and our faith, and on me. Get out of here you little pisher!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - lisa's room)
Bart Simpson: Oy, this guy's tough.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, we're gonna have to out smart him.

Waitress: That's ham, sausage and bacon with a smidge of mayo...
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (SHOCKED) What?
Waitress: ... on white bread.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Listen, you tell Mr. Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning Jewish novelist, that I lost my appetite.

(TEMPLE HALLWAY: int. temple Hallway - later)
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: You I told to go away.
Bart Simpson: But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, "A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Yes.
Bart Simpson: Then doesn't your religion command you to make up with Krusty?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: But in Exodus, the fifth commandment says, "Honor thy Father and thy Mother." End of story.
(Springfield Library: int. springfield library - day)

Moe Szyslak: Eeww!
Bart Simpson: (HOARSE) Rabbi, did not a great man say, and I quote, "The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I've heard of persecution, but what they went through is ridiculous! But the great thing is after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it." End quote.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Ohh, I never heard the plight of my people phrased so eloquently. Who said that, Rabbi Hillel?
Bart Simpson: Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: It was Judah the Pious?
Bart Simpson: Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Mamonides?
Bart Simpson: Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Oh, I got it -- the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Bart Simpson: I'm afraid not, Rabbi. It's from "Yes, I Can" by Sammy Davis Jr. An entertainer like your son.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (GASPS) The candy man?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: If a performer can think that way, maybe I'm completely upside-down on this whole problem. (BECOMING EMOTIONAL) All the years of joy that I've lost. Why? Because of my stubborn ways.

"Vin Scully": The kick is up...it's looking good... the ball is turning into a fat bald guy...
Homer Simpson: (PAINED GRUNT)
"Vin Scully": ...and it's no good. And you know what we say everytime something strange happens: "It's good that Bart did that. It's very good...."
Krusty the Clown: (TIRED LAUGH) Well, we're still on. Three hundred and forty-six consecutive hours. And all because of one little boy who... (SHARP, ALMOST HYSTERICAL) who won't let me stop! (REGAINS CONTROL) Anyway... now let's go over and see if Sideshow Mel has any more of those legal, over-the-counter wake-up drugs of his.
Kids In Audience: Yayy!
Homer Simpson: Slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh.

(Marvin Monroe's Office: ext. marvin monroe's office - establishing)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: You like attention, don't you Bart?
Bart Simpson: Do I ever! (LAUGHS)
DR MONROE: Well we all do. The problem is that you don't care whether you get good attention, for say getting good marks in school, or bad attention for .. say.. turning your father into a Jack-in-the-box.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Homer, I see you agree with my theory.
Homer Simpson: (TIGHTLY) I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Well that's too bad because the attention the boy craves should be coming from you. I want you to spend some quality time with him. Get to know him. Maybe even love him.
Homer Simpson: Ouch! (BACK AND FORTH NOISES)
Homer Simpson: Good night, son.
Bart Simpson: Good night, dad. You know, these last few days have been really swell. I wish there was something I could do to repay you.

(SECRET PASSAGEWAY: int. secret passageway)
(Laboratory: int. laboratory)
C. Montgomery Burns: You know Smithers, I've always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. So I replaced the flesh -- which is weak -- with steel, which is strong. Behold, the greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat o' nine tails.
Waylon Smithers: (GASPS) How long till it's up and running, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: Keep your pants on, Smithers. First, we need... (OMINOUSLY) The human brain.

Homer Simpson: (MUTTERING TO HIMSELF) Sheesh. What a slave driver.
Waylon Smithers: What corpse should we unearth, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONSIDERING) I don't know. I feel like a kid in a candy store.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello! An open grave. Smithers, get him out quickly, the stench is overpowering.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, will you quit your complaining.
Waylon Smithers: What a minute, sir. That's Homer Simpson. He wasn't exactly a model employee.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, who is a model (GETTING AN IDEA) ... employee?
Waylon Smithers: Ehhh... Simpson will do just fine, sir.
Waylon Smithers: Did you hear that, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: No, I didn't. Who is it? Frankenstein? The Booger Man?
Waylon Smithers: It's the man in the bag, sir. I think he's alive.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh... bad corpse. Bad corpse. Stop scaring Smithers. (TO SMITHERS) Satisfied?
Waylon Smithers: Thank you, sir.

C. Montgomery Burns: Hel-lo. Look at me, I'm Davey Crockett. (CHUCKLES)
C. Montgomery Burns: Look, Smithers, a twitch... it's moving. It's alive! Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad... well who's mad now?! (LAUGHS MANIACLLY)

Lisa Simpson: Whayda ya know, she's right.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - homer's work station)
C. Montgomery Burns: It wasn't suppose to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty, not this abomination.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh Smithers, I was wrong to play god. Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with. Now, take out that brain and flush it down the toilet.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, his family might appreciate it if you returned the brain to his body.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, come on. It's 11:45.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right.
(Laboratory: int. laboratory - a little later)
Waylon Smithers: Sir, do you know what this means? He is alive.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh you're right, Smithers. I guess I owe you a coke.

C. Montgomery Burns: Ahhh!
Waylon Smithers: Run, sir!
C. Montgomery Burns: Every bone... shattered... organs... leaking vital fluids. Slight headache... loss of appetite. Smithers, I'm going to die.
Waylon Smithers: (SCARED) Sir, is there nothing I can do?

Bart Simpson: (OUT OF BREATH) Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab.
Homer Simpson: I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMS)
C. Montgomery Burns: Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.
Homer Simpson: I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!

Lisa Simpson: I called her. She's not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement.
Homer Simpson: Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed.
(Springfield Elementary School: int. springfield elementary - auditorium - night)

Marge Simpson: Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her.
Homer Simpson: (LONG PAINFUL MOAN) Okay.
Homer Simpson: Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie.
Marge Simpson: Homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you.
Homer Simpson: Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. (MAKES FLITTING GESTURES) No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for.
Marge Simpson: We can't afford to buy a pony.
Homer Simpson: (SAGELY) Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony.
Marge Simpson: That's ridiculous.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore.
Marge Simpson: That's no reason to buy a pony!
Homer Simpson: See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes.
Marge Simpson: Stick to the subject.
Homer Simpson: Ha ha, you love me.

Homer Simpson: (WAVES HER OFF) Homer sleep now.
Lisa Simpson: What's wrong with Dad?
Marge Simpson: He's just exhausted. Lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony?
Lisa Simpson: No.
Marge Simpson: Well, it's a lot. In fact, your father had to take a second job.
Bart Simpson: The poor guy. Where's he working?
Marge Simpson: The Kwik-E-Mart.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, I hope you realize that your father can't keep this up.
Lisa Simpson: You're gonna make me give up Princess?
Marge Simpson: Lisa, we can't make you give up that pony.
Bart Simpson: I can make her. (PUNCHES FIST) Just give me five minutes alone with her.
Marge Simpson: No, Bart. No one's going to make her. This is something Lisa has to decide for herself.
Lisa Simpson: All the years I've lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face.

Lisa Simpson: Dad, you don't have to do this.
Homer Simpson: (AS IF TO A CHILD) Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money...
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I understand the sacrifice you've made for me. That's why I gave up the pony.
Homer Simpson: You did?
(Lisa's Bedroom: INT. LISA's ROOM - Day)

Dr. Nick Riviera: Thank you, Troy. Hi, everybody.
Audience: Hi, Dr. Nick.
Dr. Nick Riviera: Troy, I've brought with me the gravestone of author and troubled soul Edgar Allan Poe.
Dr. Nick Riviera: Yes, but unfortunately, a century of neglect has turned this tombstone into a depressing eyesore.
Dr. Nick Riviera: Not so fast Troy! With one application of Spiffy, you'll think the body's still warm.
Homer Simpson: (ENTHRALLED) Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Dad, you got a power drill?
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED) In the garage.
Bart Simpson: Check.
Dr. Nick Riviera: I'm offering three bottles -- enough to clean one thousand tombstones -- for only thirty-nine ninety-five.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, give us a break, Doctor.
Dr. Nick Riviera: But Troy, how can I make it lower than thirty-nine ninety-five.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Homer, I can't find the safety goggles for the power saw.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED) If stuff starts flying, just turn your head.
Bart Simpson: Oh, check.
Dr. Nick Riviera: Okay. I'll throw in a fourth bottle, the applicator glove, and a state of Kansas Jell-O mold -- twenty-nine ninety-five.

Marge Simpson: Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again?
Homer Simpson: (COVERING PHONE) Shh! They'll hear you.
Marge Simpson: Who's using the power tools?
Homer Simpson: I don't know. Some guy I guess.
Marge Simpson: Well, we're going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I'm gone.
Homer Simpson: Oh sure, great idea. I'd love to -- (SEEING LISA; annoyed grunt) Did you hear that?
Lisa Simpson: Yes.
Homer Simpson: How much?
Lisa Simpson: Everything.
Homer Simpson: What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?
Lisa Simpson: Uh... take us to the video store.
Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Anything for my little girl.
Homer Simpson: Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. (TO HIMSELF) Stupid kid.

Homer Simpson: Ooooooh, McBain.
Scoey: Hey McBain, you keep eating them hot links and you'll never make it to a pension.
Scoey: No, thanks. Got me a future, partner. I'm two days away from retirement, my daughter's graduating from college --
Scoey: And as soon as we nail Mendoza my old lady and I are gonna sail around the world like we always wanted. We just christened the boat.
Scoey: Yes, sir, everything's gonna be just perf...
Scoey: Aw, damn, damn, damn. (WEAKLY) McBain...

Marge Simpson: (IRRITATED) I don't know.
Selma Bouvier: (RE MAGAZINE) Now Henry Winkler, there's a father. Listen to what he told a close friend. (READING) "I don't always keep my cool like `The Fonz', but my love for my kids has given me plenty of 'Happy Days'."

Football Announcer: (A LA JOHN FACENDA) ... They called him "The Galloping Gazelle." His habitat: the frozen tundra of Soldier Field. For six seasons and two pro bowls he grazed on the tasty green turf of the end zone. Until one fateful Sunday in November when the gazelle was stopped in his tracks by a big cat named Wayne Kychezski. (Pronounced "Sha-chef'-ski".)
Marge Simpson: Homie, we're back.
Selma Bouvier: Don't mind that clod, Patty. You could turn the world on with your smile.
Marge Simpson: Homer, could you turn off the TV? There's a little test I want you to take.
Homer Simpson: Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman.
Marge Simpson: This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
Homer Simpson: Oh Marge.
Marge Simpson: (READING) Question one: "Name one of your child's friends..."
Homer Simpson: Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets.
Marge Simpson: They want a name, Homer, not a vague description.
Homer Simpson: Okay. (GUESSING) Hank.
Marge Simpson: Hank?! Hank who?
Homer Simpson: Hank... Jones.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you made that up. Question two: "Who is your son's hero?"
Homer Simpson: Steve McQueen.
Marge Simpson: That's your hero. "Name another dad you talked to about parenting."
Homer Simpson: (IMMEDIATELY) Next.
Marge Simpson: "What are your son's hobbies?"
Homer Simpson: Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord.
Marge Simpson: He hasn't done that since he was two.
Homer Simpson: Then he has no hobbies.
Marge Simpson: (POINTED) Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see.
Homer Simpson: Bart!... BART!!!
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?
Bart Simpson: No, not really.
Homer Simpson: Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?
Bart Simpson: Building a Soap Box Derby racer.
Homer Simpson: (DISTRAUGHT) Oh, that's a hobby!
Bart Simpson: Hey, so it is.

Barney Gumble: Wow, it really is you.
Dave: Good Lord, a zero! (PRESSES INTERCOM) Lona, cancel my one o'clock. Mr. Simpson, we'll send a wood paneled station wagon over for you immediately.
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey Bart, where'd you get the lumber?
Bart Simpson: Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, "Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine."
Martin Prince: (SNOOTY) A conventional design.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin?
Martin Prince: (COYLY) In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've booked some time at the wind tunnel.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) Goodbye, son.
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey Bart, I think they're finally hauling your dad away.
Bart Simpson: Maybe it's for the best.
(NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE: EXT. NATIONAL FATHERHOOD INSTITUTE - AFTERNOON - establishing)
Dave: For starters, Mr. Simpson, won't you take this complimentary copy of "Fatherhood" by Bill Cosby.
Homer Simpson: Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold.
Dave: Mr. Simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son.
Homer Simpson: (TESTY) Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?
Dave: Why don't you ask him yourself?
Dave: Homer, meet Dave Jr.
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Dave: (TO DAVE JR.) How's your research coming, son?
DAVE JR.: I think we're near a breakthrough.
Dave: Good work.
DAVE JR.: Thanks, Dad.
Homer Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Oh, how I envy you!
Dave: Homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn't happen over night. It took years of effort.
Homer Simpson: (UPBEAT) I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
Dave: Aw, that's the spirit, Mr. Simpson. Now step one is to find an activity the two of you can share. Does the boy have any interests?
Homer Simpson: What boy?
Dave: Your son. Find something he likes to do and share in it.
Homer Simpson: (BRIGHTENING) Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer.
Dave: Aw, that would be perfect.
Dave: Dear God! Not again.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON house - GARAGE - DUSK)
Homer Simpson: Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.
Bart Simpson: Thanks, but I'm almost done. Why don't you get back on the couch and watch TV?
Homer Simpson: Okay. (BEAT) No, I'm gonna do it.
Bart Simpson: Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad's help.
Homer Simpson: But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.
Homer Simpson: (RE CRASHING) What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you.
Bart Simpson: Come on Dad, it'd be weird.
Homer Simpson: Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING, THEN) Hmm... (READING) "Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite." Huh?
Homer Simpson: Oh, that sounds too complicated.
Homer Simpson: All right, I will! (TO BART, STIFFLY) Son, I don't think you should let me help you.
Bart Simpson: Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes.
Homer Simpson: (ECSTATIC) Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!
Homer Simpson: You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit.
Marge Simpson: (PLEASED MURMUR)
(Springfield: EXT. SPRINGFIELD - SOAPBOX DERBY TRACK - DAY)
Homer Simpson: I like our chances, son.

Bart Simpson: Helmets are for wusses, Sir.
Official: I don't think I can let you go without a safety helmet.

Homer Simpson: Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS) It's over there, Nelson.
Nelson Muntz: Whoa, talk about your pieces of crap.
Martin Prince: (RE: NELSON) You know, Bart, I don't care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy.
Nelson Muntz: Careful, boys. It took me months to steal that bumper.
Voice From Trunk: (FAINT) Help! Help!
Bart Simpson: What was that?
Nelson Muntz: You didn't hear nothin'.
Homer Simpson: Are you nervous son?
Bart Simpson: Don't worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, "Gravity is my co-pilot."

Martin Prince: But that means I can't possibly race!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Son, you're lucky to be alive.
Martin Prince: Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor.
Bart Simpson: Is it okay to visit?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (CHUCKLES) Of course.
Bart Simpson: Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death.
Martin Prince: (GLUMLY) Thanks, Bart.
Bart Simpson: You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build 'em like you.
Martin Prince: (HOLDING UP HIS ARM IN A SLING) That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you. I'll never race again.
Bart Simpson: If you don't race, then Nelson'll win!
Martin Prince: Even if I wanted to, I'm in no shape to do it. Unless... Bart, will you drive my car?
Bart Simpson: Oh, I don't know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else's it'd kill him. On the other hand... I'll do it.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON house - GARAGE - LATER THAT DAY)
Homer Simpson: Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks...
Bart Simpson: Dad... I don't know how to say this, but I don't want to drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart...
Homer Simpson: Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson.
Bart Simpson: (DETERMINED) Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win.
Homer Simpson: When did I ever teach you that?
Bart Simpson: Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin's car I can win. I'm sorry, but...
Homer Simpson: (TURNING HIS BACK) Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad.
Homer Simpson: I'll just sit here in "Li'l Lightnin'" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son.
Homer Simpson: Ow.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert's office?
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED) Why? What's wrong?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there.
Homer Simpson: Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?

Homer Simpson: Sorry.
Marge Simpson: Don't you at least have something to say to Bart?
Homer Simpson: (FALSELY) No. Can't think of a thing.

Bart Simpson: Kill spectators.

Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Yeah, things are tough all over.
Moe Szyslak: Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.

Moe Szyslak: Uh, yeah, sure.
Moe Szyslak: Oh sorry, I forgot we're out of beer.
Homer Simpson: (sHRIEKS)

Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?
Patty Bouvier: (DRINKING A BEER) If you're going for a beer, this is the last one.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer Simpson: I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
Homer Simpson: In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.
Homer Simpson: It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.
Patty Bouvier: They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea, but Selma sank right to the bottom.
Homer Simpson: I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good.

Homer Simpson: Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?
Moe Szyslak: Uh, let me check the lost and found.
Moe Szyslak: What do we got here, Bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye...
Moe Szyslak: Oh. Here we are.
Moe Szyslak: It's not without its charm.
Homer Simpson: Try lighting it on fire.
Moe Szyslak: (SMILING) Whoa! Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.
Larry: Hey, your Love Tester's busted. I want my nickel back. (COUGHS)
Moe Szyslak: Hey, buddy. Have one on the house.
Larry: Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it?
Homer Simpson: Well, it's called a "Flaming...
Moe Szyslak: Moe! It's called a "Flaming Moe"! That's right, a "Flaming Moe". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That's why it's called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin' at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe I'm Moe.
Barney Gumble: Hey, what's this?
Moe Szyslak: A sneeze guard.
Barney Gumble: Wow, it really works.
HARV: (CHUCKLING) I'll be back.
Homer Simpson: Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?

Collette: You really expect me to tell you my measurements?
Moe Szyslak: You could, but I find this way is much more accurate... and fun.
Collette: (DISGUSTED) what do you offer in the way of salary?
Moe Szyslak: Minimum wage and tips. (MEANINGFULLY) Of course there are fringe benefits.
Collette: Such as?
Moe Szyslak: An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe.

Homer Simpson: Why yes I --
Moe Szyslak: (CUTTING HIM OFF) I'm your man.
HARV: Huh uh. My name is Harv Bannister. I work for "Tipsy McStagger's Good Time Drinking and Eating Emporium".
Moe Szyslak: Oh yeah? Hey, what's Mr. McStagger really like?
HARV: Actually, there is no Tipsy McStagger. He's just a composite of other successful logos.
Moe Szyslak: Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick.
HARV: (QUICKLY) Yes, fine, I will. Anyway, I've got a proposition for you.
Moe Szyslak: Keep talkin'.
HARV: We feel your "Flaming Moe" is perfect for our restaurant chain. We want to buy the recipe.
Moe Szyslak: No dice. The "Flaming Moe" is not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink?

Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Yes, everyone knows that.
Bart Simpson: It's not true! My father invented that drink, and if you'll allow me to demonstrate...
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (GASPS, THEN STERN) Bart, are those liquor bottles?

Waylon Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir. Sector Sieben-gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently terminated.
Homer Simpson: That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
Homer Simpson: (POINTED) Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes.
Homer Simpson: Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?

C. Montgomery Burns: (EVIL SMILE) Desperate, eh? (TO SMITHERS) Advantage, Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: This is my offer. I think you'll find it's most unfair, but those are the breaks.
Hans: But Mr. Burns, this is half of what we paid you.
C. Montgomery Burns: That's my final offer, take it or leave it.
Horst: (OMINOUS) All right, Mr. Burns. You win. But beware. We Germans aren't all smiles and sunshine.

C. Montgomery Burns: Restore my office. Cancel all repairs. And rehire that chap who sassed me in the bar.
Waylon Smithers: Homer Simpson, but why?
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers. I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer. He'll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by, blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head.

Homer Simpson: (DULLY) Yeah, what do you want?
Marge Simpson: (OVER INTERCOM) My husband by my side.
Homer Simpson: (AUTOMATICALLY) You want fries with that?
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Marge?
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Marge!
Homer Simpson: (LOOKS AT HER STOMACH) Holy cow, you're as big as a house.
Marge Simpson: Homer... Come home with me.
Homer Simpson: (ASHAMED) No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... (POINTING) They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring.
Marge Simpson: Any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
Homer Simpson: Marge, for you.
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aww...
Marge Simpson: Would you mind if I took it off now? The oil is burning my finger.
Homer Simpson: Oh, sure.
Marge Simpson: Homer, do you know why I married you?
Homer Simpson: Because I knocked you up?
Marge Simpson: No, because I love you.
Marge Simpson: Come home soon.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: ext. power plant - early morning)
C. Montgomery Burns: (ENTICING) That's it. That's it. Come closer...
C. Montgomery Burns: (LAUGHS) Ironic, isn't it. The hunter has become the hunted. (MANIACAL LAUGH) Oh God, Smithers, I feel so alive.
Homer Simpson: You the boss?
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes.
Waylon Smithers: I'll call security, sir.
Homer Simpson: (ROLLING UP SLEEVES) Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!
Homer Simpson: Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man. You can treat me like dirt and I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don't like it... I can change!!
C. Montgomery Burns: Hold the phone, Smithers... (TO HOMER) I like your attitude. Feisty yet spineless.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, this man not only failed the aptitude test, he got trapped in a closet on his way out.
C. Montgomery Burns: I don't care. I haven't been this impressed since I first laid eyes on a young boot-lick named Waylon Smithers.
Homer Simpson: You mean?
C. Montgomery Burns: (EXTENDS HAND) Welcome aboard, son.
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) I got the job. (YELLS) I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!
C. Montgomery Burns: Who was that young hellcat, Smithers?

(Hospital: INT. HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM - LATER)
Homer Simpson: Marge! Marge, where's the baby?

Homer Simpson: Shut up!
Patty Bouvier: Hey, listen fatboy --
Homer Simpson: No, you listen! This is my wife and this is my kid, and I'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!
Marge Simpson: Homer, does this mean --
Homer Simpson: Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (QUIETLY) Good God.
Homer Simpson: And tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back! Then I'm going house-hunting!
Marge Simpson: Doesn't your job start tomorrow?
Homer Simpson: Eh, somebody'll cover for me.
Marge Simpson: Homer, that's -- (LABOR PAIN) Ohh!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Uh, why don't you let me handle it, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Oh, college boy, eh?
Marge Simpson: Homer, for God's sakes, let him deliver the baby!
(Hospital Room: int. hospital room - later)
Marge Simpson: Homie, isn't he beautiful?
Homer Simpson: Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me.
Homer Simpson: Ahh, Bart. Daddy's little angel.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) Why you little... He did that on purpose!
Marge Simpson: How could he? He's only ten minutes old.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - living room - present day)
Homer Simpson: Bart, Lisa. Come here for a minute...
Homer Simpson: (WARMLY) Y'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have.
Homer Simpson: As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more.
Homer Simpson: And not a day goes by that we don't thank God for all three of you.

Homer Simpson: (MESMERIZED) Mon-ey.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars.
Homer Simpson: (OBLIVIOUS) Oh, sorry.
M.C.: That's very righteous. Funky C Funky Do will be back to lip sync another one of their hits, right after this.
TV Announcer: Hey kids! Why sit in front of the TV, when you can be on the radio!?
Boy: (SINGING) WE'RE GONNA ROLL THIS TRUCKIN' CONVOY / CROSS THE U.S.A. / CON-VOY...
Homer Simpson: That could be Bart!
TV Announcer: Throw away your bulky transmitters and broadcasting towers...
TV Announcer: The SuperStar celebrity microphone lets you hear your voice through any AM radio!
Teenager: Hey good lookin', we'll be back to pick you up later.
Homer Simpson: (ADMIRING WHISTLE) He's in for some lovin'.
TV Announcer: It's the perfect gift for birthdays, graduations, board meetings.
Executive: (ON MIC) You're fired!
Homer Simpson: Hm... Bart's birthday's coming up.

Homer Simpson: (GASPS) Limited?!
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE, URGENT) Do you have any of those microphones left?
(Warehouse: int. warehouse)
Operator: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, a couple.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Homer Simpson: Y'know, Marge. Bart's really gonna like my birthday present this year. It won't be like those shoe trees I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I'll buy his love yet.
Marge Simpson: (PLEASED MURMUR)
Krusty the Clown: Okay, Sideshow Mel, bring out the birthday cake!
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS) Hey kids, while Sideshow Mel mops up, let's see the names of our Krusty birthday pals for today!
Bart Simpson: All right! Here comes my name!
Bart Simpson: Wow, best eight bucks I ever spent.
Marge Simpson: Bart, your Grampa's on the phone. He wants to wish you a happy birthday.
Bart Simpson: Isn't that nice? Take a message. (HOLDS UP COUPONS) Right now I'm off to hit forty-six local merchants for free birthday goods and services.
(Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor: int. Phineas Q. Butterfat's - day)

Selma Bouvier: Mmm-hmm. We have one at home. Before we got it I was always finding Patty's stubble in my leg razor.
Bart Simpson: Ehhh...
Homer Simpson: Bart, I'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present!
Bart Simpson: (UNIMPRESSED) Next.
Marge Simpson: Bart! Be polite.
Bart Simpson: (FLAT) Next, please.
Martin Prince: Bart, I've noticed your birthday presents are a poor crop at best. I hope this turns the tide.
Patty Bouvier: Just gorgeous.
Martin Prince: (TO BART) Now we can be twins!
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING)
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) There's only one can of beer left and it's Bart's.
Homer Simpson: Hey boy, how's the microphone working?
Bart Simpson: Fine.
Homer Simpson: Bart! I would love to get a present like that.
Bart Simpson: Here you go. Enjoy.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Listen, boy, this is a great invention! Watch.
Homer Simpson: (SINGING) WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / ROCKIN' THROUGH THE NIGHT / WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / AIN'T SHE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT / CON-VOY
Lisa Simpson: Quit it, Dad!
Homer Simpson: Hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!
Marge Simpson: Wha'd you say? I can't understand you with all that distortion.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
(Bart's Bedroom: Int. Bart's room - later)
Bart Simpson: What a crappy birthday.
Bart Simpson: (EXPLODING) What do you mean, how did I get on the radio? I created the universe! Stupid kids.
Marge Simpson: Y'know Bart, I don't think this is such a bad present. Maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does.
Marge Simpson: (INTO MIC) Testing... testing... One, two, three... Oh, my. Do I sound like that?
Bart Simpson: (BRIGHTENING) Hey, it does work!
Marge Simpson: I bet you could have a lot of fun with this. Why don't you go show your father?
Bart Simpson: (IMPISHLY) Hmmm.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen)
Homer Simpson: Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer Simpson: Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream.
Marge Simpson: I'll get some at the store tomorrow, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Bart Simpson: People of Earth, this is Bartron, commander of the Martian invasion force. Your planet is in our hands. Resistance is useless.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
Bart Simpson: We have captured your president. He was delicious.
Homer Simpson: Why, you little...
Homer Simpson: (REALIZING) Wait a minute. Does this mean you like my present?
Bart Simpson: (CHOKING) Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson: Aww...
Homer Simpson: Just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes.
Bart Simpson: I promise.
Bart Simpson: (BABY VOICE) Mama! Mama!
Marge Simpson: Maggie! You talked! Can you say "mama" again?
Bart Simpson: (BABY VOICE) Sorry lady, show's over.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Bart.
Lisa Simpson: I dreamed I was married to Corey, and we lived on a pony farm...and Corey was always walking around with his shirt off.
Bart Simpson: Oh, brotherrr.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - BART'S CLASSROOM)
Bart Simpson: (MOCK HORROR) Mrs. Krabappel! That was uncalled for!
Milhouse Van Houten: Bravo!
Nelson Muntz: Well done, old man.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART'S ROOM - EVENING)
Bart Simpson: (MOCK DEEP VOICE) Rod... Todd... this is God.
Rod Flanders: How did you get on the radio?
Todd Flanders: (SCARED) Forgive my brother. We believe you.
Bart Simpson: Talk is cheap. Perhaps a test of thy faith. Walk through the wall. I will remove it for you...later.
Todd Flanders: What do you want from us?
Bart Simpson: I got a job for thee. Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen and leave them on the Simpsons porch.
Rod Flanders: But those cookies belong to our parents.
Bart Simpson: (EXASPERATED SIGH) Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?
Rod Flanders: Happy God.
Bart Simpson: Then quit flapping your lip and make with the cookies.
Todd Flanders: Yes, sir.
(Springfield Elementary School Back Field: EXT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BACK FIELD - DAY)
Bart Simpson: (WHISTLING)
Bart Simpson: Whoops!
Bart Simpson: Help! Help!
Groundskeeper Willie: Hoot mon! Sounds like trouble a-brewin' at the old well.
Bart Simpson: (PHONY VOICE) Help me, please! I fell down the well!
Groundskeeper Willie: I'll get help, laddie!
Groundskeeper Willie: (TO HIMSELF) A little nip of courage.
Groundskeeper Willie: (TO CARS) Out of my way! Look out, you horse's arse!
Bart Simpson: Sucker.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON)
Homer Simpson: Hey, what's up?
Jasper Beardly: Some fool kid fell down a well.
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Yes!
(Well: EXT. WELL - A LITTLE LATER)
Bart Simpson: My name is Timmy O'Toole. I just turned ten years old.
Dave Shutton: Timmy, where are your parents?
Bart Simpson: Uh... I have no family. I tried to enroll in school, but your Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes.
Seymour Skinner: He's a liar!
Crowd: (TO SKINNER) Booooooo!
Kent Brockman: The circumference of the well is thirty-four inches. So, unfortunately, not one member of our city's police force is slender enough to rescue the boy.
Chief Wiggum: By God, men -- you're a bunch of marshmallows!
Fat Cop: Why don't you go, Chief?
Chief Wiggum: (EMBARRASSED) I'm too... important.
Lisa Simpson: Is it Sherri?
Kent Brockman: Although the well is too dark to see the boy, Timmy has told us his foot is trapped under a rock. Thus, any attempt to pull him up would snap him like a twig.
Kent Brockman: In desperation, the city is considering more unorthodox solutions.
Falcon Man: Grasping the child firmly in his talons, Socrates here will fly him to safety! Just watch!
Falcon Man: I don't think he's coming back.
Sailor: With this hook, and this hunk of chocolate, I'll land your boy. And I'll clean him for free.
Professor Jonathan Frink: Although we can't reach your boy, we can freeze him with liquid nitrogen so that future generations can rescue him.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING)
Marge Simpson: Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little Timmy O'Toole, trapped in that well.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHS HEARTILY)
Marge Simpson: Bart! What's wrong with you?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero.
Lisa Simpson: How do you mean, dad?
Homer Simpson: Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out...
Lisa Simpson: How does that make him a hero?
Homer Simpson: Well, it's more than you did!
Kent Brockman: And finally, Channel Six's own Krusty the Clown has gathered members of the entertainment community -- who normally steer clear of fashionable causes -- for a video called "We're Sending Our Love Down The Well."
Krusty the Clown: I wanted to do something to help that boy. So I called my good friend Sting. He said, "Krusty, when do you need me?" I said Thursday -- he said, "I'm busy Thursday" -- I said, "What about Friday?" He said, "Friday's worse than Thursday." Then he said, "How about Saturday?" I said, "Fine." (BEAT) True story.
Sting: Yeah, I used to open for Krusty in uh, '69. In fact, he fired me as I recall.
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS WEAKLY) Sting.
Sting: But this isn't about show business. This is about some kid down a hole, or something, and we've all got to do what we can.
Sting: (SINGING) THERE'S A HOLE IN MY HEART / AS DEEP AS A WELL / FOR THAT POOR LITTLE BOY / WHO'S STUCK HALF-WAY TO HELL.
Sideshow Mel: (SINGING) THOUGH WE CAN'T GET HIM OUT / WE'LL DO THE NEXT BEST THING.
Groundskeeper Willie: Gas! Out of the hole!
Choir: (SINGING) AND WE'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL!
Krusty the Clown: (SINGS) ALL THE WAY DOWN.
Choir: (SING) WE'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL!
Krusty the Clown: (SINGS) DOWN THAT WELL!
Kent Brockman: Krusty, what are your plans for the royalties?
Krusty the Clown: Well, we gotta pay for promotion, shipping, distribution... you know, those limos out back -- they aren't free... Whatever's left, we throw down the well.
(Well: EXT. WELL - NIGHT)
Souvenir Hawker: Authentic Timmy O'Toole baby teeth! Six dollars a bag!
Bernard: Step to the rear... plenty of room in the back.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON)
Lisa Simpson: (CHUCKLES, THEN) Awww.
Bart Simpson: Drop that microphone! Drop it, boy!
Station Announcer: This is a special report from Channel Six news.
Kent Brockman: Disturbing news from the old town well, where young Timmy O'Toole has apparently taken a turn for the worse.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: I... a, it's very simple, Kent. The child is reverting to a feral, or wolf-like, state. Here's an artist's conception.
Lisa Simpson: (WHISPERS) Bart!
Bart Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT) I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn't get through my sock. (SEES LISA) Goodnight everybody. (SNORES)
Lisa Simpson: Bart Simpson! The thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. When they find out you've been fooling them, they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors.
Bart Simpson: Oh yeah? And how are they gonna find out?
Lisa Simpson: The police will catch you sooner or later.
Bart Simpson: The police. (SNORTS) They couldn't catch a cold.
Lisa Simpson: Maybe not, but I bet you're stupid enough to have left a "Property of Bart Simpson" label on that radio.
Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(Well: EXT. WELL - NIGHT)
Lou: And Cinderella had the most beautiful gown at the ball. With eight satin petticoats, each more delicate than the last. (BEAT) I think he's asleep.
Eddie: Want to get a cup of coffee?
Lou: Okay. (POINTING TO WELL) Brave little guy.
Eddie: Hey, I almost tripped over this thing.
Bart Simpson: (DEATH SCREAM)
Bart Simpson: (MOANS) What did I do to deserve this?
Bart Simpson: (SHOUTING) Help! Help! I fell down the well.
Eddie: Tell us something we don't know.
Bart Simpson: No! My name is Bart Simpson!
Lou: What are you doing down there?
Bart Simpson: (THINKING A BEAT) Look, I'll level with you. There is no Timmy O'Toole. It was just a prank I was playing on everybody.
Lou: (MAD) Well, you sure fooled us, kid.
Eddie: Hey, I got an idea for a prank. Let's go home and go to sleep. (CHUCKLE).
Lou: Good one, Eddie.
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS LAUGH) Great joke, guys. Ha ha. Ha. (BEAT) Guys?
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - next day)
Lou: So I'm afraid your son is trapped down the well.
Homer Simpson: You must think we're the worst parents in the world.
Eddie: Yeah, that's... pretty much the feeling down at the station.
(Well: ext. well - a little later)
Homer Simpson: (SOOTHING) Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll...
Bart Simpson: Ow! Knock it off you bald boob!
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) Hey, don't make me come down there!
Bart Simpson: Like to see you fit.
Homer Simpson: Why, you little --
Mayor Joe Quimby: Put a man on him.
Old Lady #1: I liked the other boy. So polite.
Marge Simpson: (DISTRAUGHT) What are you doing to save my baby boy?
Chief Wiggum: Uh well, ma'am, we've located a piece of machinery in Shreveport, Louisiana, that could pop him out lickety-split.
Marge Simpson: Well, why don't you get it?
Chief Wiggum: Well, I'm afraid we've got a budget problem, Mrs. Simpson. Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well. Had he done it at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo.
Marge Simpson: You're telling me that the city won't pay to get a boy out of a well?
Chief Wiggum: Well, they would have for Timmy. People loved that little guy. But your son, well, he kinda played us all for a bunch of saps.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Gentlemen, this canary died of natural causes.
Groundskeeper Willie: Back in the hole!
Bart Simpson: (DISGUSTED) No!
Kent Brockman: So it seems we've all been the victims of a cruel hoax, perpetrated by a ten-year-old-hooligan. The time has come for finger-pointing. And most of them are squarely aimed at the boy's parents.
Homer Simpson: It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Uh, could you edit that last part out?
Kent Brockman: Mr. Simpson, we're live coast-to-coast.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Wanda: One plus one plus three is five/ Little Bart Simpson's buried alive / He's so neat / He's so sweet / Now the rats have Bart to eat.
Lisa Simpson: Hey, stop that!
JANEY: Sorry, Lisa.
JANEY: How many days until Bart croaks. (SPINNING FASTER) One, two, three, four...
D.J.: (CASEY KASEM VOICE) And our new number one hit, "I Do Believe We're Naked", by Funky C Funky Do, replaces "We're Sending Our Love Down The Well", which plunges all the way down to number ninety-seven.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Ever since I've called for the rescue of that Simpson lad, I 'Have taken a lot of heat. So, I am flip-flopping. I say, "Let him stay down there!"
Dave Shutton: Yeah, Shutton here. (LISTENS) Now that's a story!
Marge Simpson: Bart? Honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're down in the well.
Bart Simpson: Mom, it's too big.
Homer Simpson: Don't worry, you'll grow into it.
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) Homer!
Bart Simpson: You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. I guess now I'm paying the price. But there's so many things I'll never get a chance to do. Smoke a cigarette, use a fake I.D., shave a swear word in my hair...
Homer Simpson: That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself.
Groundskeeper Willie: Now, why didn't I think of that?
Groundskeeper Willie: (to shovel) Agnes, we've got work to do.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Kent Brockman: (GRIM) This is Kent Brockman with a special bulletin. The Lincoln Squirrel has been assassinated. We'll stay with the story all night if we have to.
Lisa Simpson: What's going on?
Jasper Beardly: It's an old fashioned hole diggin'. By gar, it's been a while.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (GASP) The canary!
Marge Simpson: Sting, you look tired. Maybe you should take a rest.
Sting: Not while one of my fans needs me.
Marge Simpson: Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums--
Homer Simpson: (TO MARGE) Shh! Marge, he's a good digger.
Bart Simpson: Sting!
Bart Simpson: Mom! Dad!
Marge Simpson: Oh Bart, I've missed you so much.
Bart Simpson: Man, I was so scared.
Homer Simpson: (SMILING) Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again.
(Well: ext. well - sunset)
Groundskeeper Willie: That should do it.
Bret: Hey everybody, Bret Gunsilman here in pivotal week three of the NFL on Fox.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON house - LIVING ROOM - continuous)
Bret: Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action.
Homer Simpson: Well, bye-bye belt.
Marge Simpson: Homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart.
Homer Simpson: Pfft, my heart is just fine.
Homer Simpson: A little beer will put out that fire.
Bret: And now with his picks for today's games, the man who's right fifty-two percent of the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo.
JIMMY: Thank you, Bret. Our first game today -- Denver and New England -- is too close to call.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
JIMMY: But if you're one of those compulsive types who just has to bet -- well, I don't know... uh... Denver.
Homer Simpson: Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!
(Moe's Tavern: int. Moe's tavern - day)
Moe Szyslak: Moe's Tavern. Where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.
Homer Simpson: Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver.
Moe Szyslak: (SLYLY) I think I can provide that service. (LOOKING AROUND) Um, uh, Chief Wiggum, could you hand me that little black book?
Chief Wiggum: Oh, sure thing, Moe. I was just using it as a coaster.
Homer Simpson: Twenty big ones on Denver.
Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Pleasure doing business with you, (COYLY) H. S.
Homer Simpson: (TO TV) All right, Denver. Justify my love.
Lisa Simpson: I don't know, the Dolphins.
Football Announcer: At the end of thirteen seconds of play, it's New England seven, Denver nothing.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Lisa Simpson: Look, Dad. I made a modest studio apartment for my Malibu Stacey doll. This is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter...
Lisa Simpson: DAAAAAD! You're not listening to me.
Homer Simpson: (GRUMBLING) Lousy, stupid Denver.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - Kitchen - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Oh, look at that, a shoe box house. Lisa, you're so clever.
Lisa Simpson: Why isn't Dad ever interested in anything I do?
Marge Simpson: Well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does?
Lisa Simpson: No.... well, we used to have burping contests, but I outgrew it.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, well, if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap. I do it all the time. I pretend I'm interested in looking at power tools, going to those silly car chase movies, and... some things I'll tell you about when you're older. Do you understand?
Lisa Simpson: I think so.
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Whaaat?
Announcer: Ho, look at that score. Moxy!
Homer Simpson: Why did you do that?
Lisa Simpson: (HOPEFULLY) Wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
Homer Simpson: (EXASPERATED SIGH) Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there.
Homer Simpson: Over.
Homer Simpson: Over... over... over...
Homer Simpson: Lisa, please, I can't hear the announcer.
Lisa Simpson: He said Denver just fumbled.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Bart Simpson: (NORMAL VOICE) See you in Hell, soldier boy! (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: Bart?
Bart Simpson: Yeah mom?
Marge Simpson: I was thinking that while your father and Lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping.
Bart Simpson: Mom, I'd love to. But to be honest, I don't need new clothes.
Marge Simpson: Oh really?
Marge Simpson: (DISAPPROVING) Hmm...
Bart Simpson: So even though I'd love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes. It's not...
JIMMY: (CHUCKLING) Well folks, when you're right fifty-two percent of the time, you're wrong forty-eight percent of the time.
Homer Simpson: (FURIOUS) Why didn't you say that before!
Bret: (CHUCKLING) Okay, Jimmy, you're off the hook. We've got Miami Cincinnati coming up. Any thoughts?
JIMMY: I certainly do, Brett. I hereby declare Miami to be Smooth Jimmy's "Lock of the Week."
Homer Simpson: Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy.
Sportscaster: In the Cincinnati - Miami game, I declare Cincinnati to be my "Shoe-in of the Week".
Homer Simpson: Huh, they both make a good case.
Professor Jonathan Frink: After evaluating millions of pieces of data in the blink of an eye, the Gambletron 2000 says the winner is... (READING A PRINTOUT) Cincinnati by two hundred points?! Why you worthless hunk of junk!
Coach: (FAST) You want some of this don't ya?
Homer Simpson: Yeah!

Coach: ...is blowing out of the west...
Homer Simpson: Oh...
Coach: at five
Homer Simpson: ... miles per hour.
Coach: knots...
Homer Simpson: (PANICKED) Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?
Homer Simpson: Good, good. (DIALING PHONE) Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins.
Moe Szyslak: Gotcha, fifty beans on Miami. Um, Homer, I got a call on the other line. (TAPS PHONE) Hello?

Bart Simpson: Fine, get it. Lets go.
Marge Simpson: No, no, no, you have to try it on.
Marge Simpson: Oooh, and this one's fifty percent off.
Bart Simpson: You know why these clothes are on sale, Mom? Because the people who wear them get beaten up.
Marge Simpson: Well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend. Ooh this looks good.... oh and this one is very, very cute... (PILING ON MORE CLOTHES) And these... (BEAT) Oh look! Little bow ties.
Marge Simpson: And don't make that face at me.

Homer Simpson: Whoo-hoo!
Lisa Simpson: Whoo-hoo!
Homer Simpson: Fifty big ones!
Lisa Simpson: (PUZZLED) Fifty big ones?
Homer Simpson: Uh-oh. (STUCK) You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game.
Lisa Simpson: You mean you made a bet?
Homer Simpson: Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting.
Lisa Simpson: What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
Homer Simpson: Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?
Lisa Simpson: Uh-huh.
Marge Simpson: See how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
Homer Simpson: And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream (GETTING ENGROSSED) and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things...
Lisa Simpson: So gambling makes a good thing even better.

Football Announcer #2: And the final from Riverfront Stadium, Miami 24 -- Cincinnati 10.
Homer Simpson: YEAH!
Lisa Simpson: Boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars.
Homer Simpson: You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible.
Lisa Simpson: Really, where?
Homer Simpson: Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?
Lisa Simpson: Okay, dad.
Marge Simpson: Did you two have fun?
Homer Simpson: (COYLY) You bet.
Marge Simpson: Well, we had fun too. Right now, Bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: You gotta come out sometime, Simpson.
Lisa Simpson: Goodnight, Dad. I had a really nice time today.
Homer Simpson: Me too, honey.

Homer Simpson: All right!
Lisa Simpson: He'll lose.
Homer Simpson: What? Didn't you hear what he said?
Lisa Simpson: Look at the fear in his eyes. Listen to the quiver in his voice. He's a little boy, lost in a game of men.
Homer Simpson: You think we should bet against them?
Lisa Simpson: I'd bet my entire college fund on it.
Homer Simpson: You got it.
Homer Simpson: Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York.
Football Announcer: Start spreadin' the news, it's New York over Philadelphia, thirty-five to ten.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I'm getting nauseous.
Homer Simpson: (PUTTING HER DOWN) Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games?
Lisa Simpson: Well, I like the 49ers because they're pure of heart -- Seattle because they got something to prove -- and the Raiders because they always cheat.
Football Announcer: And in an extremely suspicious play, the Raiders win.
Lisa Simpson: (CHEER)

Homer Simpson: My daughter, that's who!
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, me!
Homer Simpson: Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift.
Lisa Simpson: C'mon, dad. It doesn't take a genius to realize that Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game.
Homer Simpson: Oh, my little girl says the cutest things.
Lisa Simpson: (HAPPILY) You know, dad, Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week.

Lisa Simpson: Mom, can't a man do something nice for his loved ones?

JIMMY: (SMOOTH) He doesn't look too happy.
Bret: (CHUCKLES) Well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he's slowly suffocating. Still, that is a real fan.
Homer Simpson: Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks.
Homer Simpson: You promised you wouldn't get mad!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I'm making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. And with your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago.
Homer Simpson: Good, good... You call Moe.

Lisa Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT) The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago. I was sitting on my daddy's knee when the Saints, who were four and a half point favorites, but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second, to cover the spread.
Miss Hoover: Dear God!

Homer Simpson: Boy, I know you're gonna like your present.
Box: (MECHANICAL VOICE) Shut up. Shut up. Kiss my butt. Shut up. Go to Hell. Go to Hell.
Bart Simpson: Dad, I promise you I will never get tired of this.
Marge Simpson: Homer, those are very thoughtful presents. But you have to tell me where you got the money from.
Homer Simpson: (TRAPPED) All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad.
Marge Simpson: I promise I will get mad, because I always do when you make me promise I won't.
Homer Simpson: All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Marge Simpson: I did not! I promised I would get mad! She's an eight-year-old girl.
Homer Simpson: But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?
Marge Simpson: But gambling is illegal.
Homer Simpson: Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together.
Marge Simpson: Well, I just don't know.
Homer Simpson: Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted.
Homer Simpson: Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this.
Lisa Simpson: You know, dad, we've been watching a lot of TV lately. Maybe, the Sunday after the Super Bowl, we could hike up to the top of Mount Springfield. The fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets.
Homer Simpson: Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney.
Lisa Simpson: (SHOCKED) What about Daddy-Daughter day?
Homer Simpson: Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away.
Lisa Simpson: So that's it. You just wanted me to help you gamble. You never wanted to be with me at all.

Homer Simpson: Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat.
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Lisa Simpson: So you've come to buy my forgiveness. Sorry, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, I did.
Homer Simpson: Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh? (CHUCKLES)
Lisa Simpson: (WARMING) Well, I would like to see what all the fuss is about.
Homer Simpson: It's a date! (SLYLY) So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread?
Lisa Simpson: (GOES COLD) Put me down.
Lisa Simpson: Look dad, I'll tell you who's gonna win the Super Bowl if you want me to. But it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me.
Homer Simpson: (THINKS A BEAT) Okay.
Lisa Simpson: I think Dallas is a mortal lock.
Homer Simpson: Dallas! Whoo-hoo!
Lisa Simpson: However...
Homer Simpson: (FRANTIC) However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?
Lisa Simpson: However, I may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously I want you to lose. In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: "Daddy should bet all his money on..."

Bret: Could be another Drexel's Class. Ooh, looks like we're almost ready for the kickoff.

Homer Simpson: Ohh, you son-of-a.
Ned Flanders: Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial.
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal.
Homer Simpson: You dirty bas...
Homer Simpson: What do ya think, Lisa?
Lisa Simpson: How's the dog supposed to get in?

(Springfield Elementary School: int. springfield elementary - bart's classroom - day)

Bart Simpson: What's wrong with Principal Skinner?

Bart Simpson: (GUILTY MOAN)
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - backyard - day)
Homer Simpson: (CALMLY) Oh fudge, that's broken.
Homer Simpson: (CALMLY) Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse.
Homer Simpson: Where'd you get the money?
Marge Simpson: There was more than enough in the swear jar. (COY) And if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise.

Bart Simpson: Mrs. Krabappel.
Homer Simpson: (WHISTLES) Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night. (GROWL)
Marge Simpson: Homer! Bart, you did a very cruel thing.
Homer Simpson: Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth.
Marge Simpson: No, Homer. The truth would humiliate her.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear.
Lisa Simpson: Maybe we should write her another letter. One that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
Homer Simpson: Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty.
Homer Simpson: "Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you."
Marge Simpson: (GENTLY) We'll all help.
Lisa Simpson: "Though I'll be inoculating babies in Kampuchea, my heart will always be with you."
Bart Simpson: That sucks. How 'bout, "Crocodiles bit off my face."
Marge Simpson: That's disgusting. And besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face.
Homer Simpson: I may hold you to that, Marge.
Lisa Simpson: "Okay, okay... I cannot see you for the next five years, for I will be farming the ocean floor."

Homer Simpson: It's something very special. A home-made bat. (TELLING STORY) It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house...
Homer Simpson: Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find.
Homer Simpson: Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of.
Homer Simpson: I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
Marge Simpson: Homie, come to bed.
Marge Simpson: Homer, go back to the garage.

ARI: Would you care to bet a million dollars on that?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting?
ARI: (PUZZLED) What? A million dollars isn't interesting to you?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, did you say a million? I'm... I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere. I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would bait each other and... well, you know how it goes. Yes... certainly, a million will be fine.
C. Montgomery Burns: Um-hm.
(Burns's Office: int. burns' office)
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, I've been thinking. Is it wrong to cheat in order to win a million dollar bet?

Waylon Smithers: No, sir! Whom should I kill?
Homer Simpson: I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry!
C. Montgomery Burns: No, Smithers. I've decided to bring in a few ringers. Professional baseballers.
C. Montgomery Burns: We'll give them token jobs at the plant and have them play on our softball team. Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown...
Waylon Smithers: Uh... sir...
C. Montgomery Burns: What is it, Smithers?
Waylon Smithers: I'm afraid... all those players have retired and... uh... passed on. In fact, your right fielder has been dead for a hundred and thirty years.

Homer Simpson: Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.
Bart Simpson: You make me sick Homer. You're the one who told me I could do anything if I just put my mind to it.

Waylon Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Or Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: Secondly, instead of beer, from now on you will all be drinking this!

Waylon Smithers: (SHOCKED) What?
Darryl Strawberry: You're pinch-hitting for me?
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes. You see, you're a left-hander. And so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it's called playing the percentages. It's what smart managers do to win ballgames.
Darryl Strawberry: But I've got nine home runs today.

Kent Brockman: But there's already one big winner. Our state's school system, which gets fully half the profits from the lottery.
Marge Simpson: You can still win some money if you have five out of six.
Homer Simpson: Whoo-hoo!
Seymour Skinner: Just think what we can buy with that money. (DREAMILY) History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don't have that Base six crap in them.

Lisa Simpson: (GASP)
Bart Simpson: Grampa, he's not dead!
Homer Simpson: Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not.
Lisa Simpson: It's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that.
Grampa Simpson: He is dead! I'll get a shovel.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED) Well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick.
Grampa Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) Oh, sure! The old man's off his rocker. If Grampa says he's dead he must be alive.
Lisa Simpson: He is alive. He's wagging his tail.
Grampa Simpson: (FLUSTERED. TRYING TO DEFEND HIS POSITION) That don't mean nothin'! Dogs wag their tails for hours after they die. I'm tired of this conversation. Let's talk about something else. I'm going home.

(Animal Hospital: INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - VET'S OFFICE)
Vet: Clear! Ugh... Clear!
Nurse: Doctor... he's gone.
Vet: (SIGHS) This is the part of the job I hate.
Homer Simpson: Hey, you did the best you could.
Vet: I love animals. I spend my life saving them and they can't thank me. Well... the parrots can -- but, anyway let's see what's wrong with this little fella.
Vet: I'm afraid that your dog has a twisted stomach. He needs an operation to correct it or he'll die.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Marge Simpson: Hmm, how much will it cost?
Vet: Seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Marge Simpson: Oh dear!
Vet: This is never an easy decision. It's an awful lot of money.
Homer Simpson: Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over.
Bart Simpson: Talk what over? What's there to talk about?
Bart Simpson: What are we going to talk over?
Krusty the Clown: (TO RECEPTIONIST) Mr. Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - a little later)
Bart Simpson: I can't help but notice we're leaving the hospital. When's the dog going to get his operation?
Homer Simpson: Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen)
Homer Simpson: In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and...
Bart Simpson: Is there a Doggie Hell?
Homer Simpson: Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
Bart Simpson: Who's in there?
Homer Simpson: Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester.
Lisa Simpson: Checkers.
Homer Simpson: Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.
Bart Simpson: (SUSPICIOUSLY) Hey! Wait a minute, does this have anything to do with Santa's Little Helper?
Marge Simpson: Oh, honey. Seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. We really can't afford this operation.
Bart Simpson: You're gonna just let him die?
Marge Simpson: I know you're upset --
Bart Simpson: Darn right I'm upset!
Marge Simpson: Bart, watch your language. (THINKS) Oh. You did. Sorry.
Bart Simpson: We are not going to let our dog die! And that's IT! (UNDER BREATH) Lousy dog-killing sonsa...
Homer Simpson: But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
Homer Simpson: (TO DOG) Oh, come on! (FIRMLY) I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. (WHINES) Marge, make him stop.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks, Mom.
Homer Simpson: All right. All right. We'll find a way. (MUMBLES) Lousy manipulative dog.
(Burns's Office: int. burns' office)
Homer Simpson: Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
C. Montgomery Burns: Please, do go on...
Homer Simpson: I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, please, continue...
Homer Simpson: I thought maybe you...
Homer Simpson: (SEEING GUARDS) Oh. (TO BURNS) Well, thanks for your time.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SHAKES HEAD) What makes a man endanger his job, and yes, even his life, by asking me for money?
Waylon Smithers: People like dogs, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?
Waylon Smithers: Uh... if YOU did it, sir?...
C. Montgomery Burns: (NOT LISTENING) Exactly! You'd be fit to be tied! (CONTEMPT) Dogs!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - evening)
Marge Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: What?
Marge Simpson: You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself.
Homer Simpson: But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
Homer Simpson: Maybe you're right, Marge.
Marge Simpson: I've found a way we can pay for the operation.
Homer Simpson: (HAPPY) Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?
Marge Simpson: No. I'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. Homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while.
Marge Simpson: Bart, from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at Springfield Barber College.
Bart Simpson: No problemo.
Marge Simpson: I'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and I found a way to stretch the food budget. Fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. Ham night will be Spam night. And porkchop night...
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
Marge Simpson: ... will now be chub night.
Homer Simpson: (TO SELF) Chub? I don't even know what that is!
Marge Simpson: Lisa, I'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of Encyclopedia Generica from the grocery store.
Lisa Simpson: (DISTRAUGHT) But, Mom, next week is volume four: Copernicus through Elephantiasis.
Marge Simpson: We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer...
Homer Simpson: Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats...
Marge Simpson: I don't think you've thought this through.
(Animal Hospital: int. animal hospital - waiting room)
Nurse: Good news, Mr. Danielson, we saved your gamecock. But I'm afraid he'll never fight again.

God: Come to the light, boy. (WHISTLES) Come into the light. Come on now. There's a good boy. Come on. Come on.
Nurse: Um... Simpson?
Vet: It's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of dental school.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - establishing)
Homer Simpson: Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?
Marge Simpson: You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly just snouts and entrails.
Homer Simpson: Mmm... snouts.
Kent Brockman: Yes, I'm back. Kent Brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. Hey, I'm a journalist.
Homer Simpson: (MUTTERING) Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy.
Marge Simpson: What's that?
Homer Simpson: (THINKS, THEN:) A dinosaur.
Kent Brockman: Of course I'm not the only one who benefited from last week's big payoff. Our state's schools got their share too. Here, lottery officials present Springfield Elementary with a brand new eraser.
Seymour Skinner: (BITTER) One eraser? Oh, I'm used to my government betraying me. I was in Nam. I served for three --
Kent Brockman: And speaking of lotteries, here are the winning numbers for this week's forty-thousand dollar (CONDESCENDING) "jackpot": 3 - 6 - 17 - 18 - 22 and 29.
Marge Simpson: Oh no! Those are my numbers! If it wasn't for that dog, I would've won!

Young Barfly: Who's that old rummy?
Moe Szyslak: (OFFENDED) Before his dog got sick, that "old rummy" used to be my best customer.

Marge Simpson: (TO SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER) Not now.
Lisa Simpson: (BITTER) Can't you see I'm reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station?
Bart Simpson: Dumb dog.
Marge Simpson: Homie, did you close the gate?
Homer Simpson: (SLEEPY) Yes.
Homer Simpson: (COVERING) Oh, you mean tonight.
Marge Simpson: The dog will get out!
Homer Simpson: (YELLING) Bart! Close the gate.
Bart Simpson: (SLEEPILY) Lisa! Close the gate.
Lisa Simpson: (YAWNS) Close the gate, Maggie.
Marge Simpson: (CALLING) Here boy!
Bart Simpson: (WHISTLES)
Lisa Simpson: (CALLING) Here Santa's Little Helper!

Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
C. Montgomery Burns: (SOTTO) Release the hounds. (TO FLANDERS) Well, neighbor I see you've got your running shoes on. That's a good thing.
C. Montgomery Burns: What's wrong with Crippler?
Waylon Smithers: He's getting on, sir. He's been here since the late sixties.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah yes, I'll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie. That young man didn't think it was too "groovy." (CHUCKLES)
(Dog Pound: int. dog pound)
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm looking for something in an attack dog. One who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why here's the fellow! Wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. Reminds me of me.
Homer Simpson: Uh...the last one.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now! As an attack dog, you'll be expected to neutralize intruders.
Waylon Smithers: Wanna buy some cookies? Wanna buy some cookies?
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISGUSTED) If that were a real Girl Scout I'd have been bothered by now.
Barney Gumble: I know how you feel, I lost my dog too. (LOOKS IN HOUSE) He's in here somewhere.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now here's a film that will turn you into a vicious souless killer. Enjoy.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Lisa Simpson: Poor Santa's Little Helper. I'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
Homer Simpson: (TEARY) That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug.
Marge Simpson: (EYEING KIDS) Homer get a-hold of yourself. Even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. Remember Doggie Heaven.
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING) Oh, Marge! There is no such place!
Homer Simpson: Or... to put it another way... there is.
Bart Simpson: I'm not giving up. I don't care if I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. I'm gonna find my dog.

Bart Simpson: Gee, I'm sorry mister.
Butler: (TO KENT) Sir, your llama just bit Ted Kennedy.
Kent Brockman: Good.

(Car: int. car - after movie)

Marge Simpson: Has she kissed you?
Homer Simpson: A coupla times.
Marge Simpson: I want you to stop seeing her.
Homer Simpson: I can't. I'm her manager.
Marge Simpson: Her manager? That's ridiculous. I won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer.
Marge Simpson: Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. And you did it at the county fair last year. Remember?

Lurleen Lumpkin: (SINGS) THAT'S RIGHT! I FINALLY BAGGED ME A HOMER.
Mr. Boylan: Lurleen, we're gonna have to cut you off. We're getting some kind of grinding noise on the track.
Homer Simpson: (SNAPPING FINGERS) You, off the bench.
(Lurleen's Trailer: int. lurleen's trailer - night)
Homer Simpson: Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV.
Lurleen Lumpkin: Oh Homer! You're as smart as you are handsome.
Homer Simpson: (OFFENDED) Hey! (BEAT) Oh, you meant that as a compliment. (THEN) Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new.
Lurleen Lumpkin: (SUGGESTIVELY) Well, I have been working on something that could really heat things up.

Lurleen Lumpkin: (SIGHS)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - afternoon)
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) All our money's tied up in this woman. If she fails, we're broke. If she succeeds, I have no husband. I don't know what to root for.
Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) You don't?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) I gotta go. (HANGS UP) Homer...
Homer Simpson: Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight. I gotta get ready.
Marge Simpson: Just so you know, while you and Lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, Maggie cut her first tooth.
Homer Simpson: (ABSENTLY) That's great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?
Marge Simpson: You're not even listening to me!
Homer Simpson: (NOT LISTENING) Sure they will.
Marge Simpson: Kids, will you come in here?
Marge Simpson: You've got a wonderful family, Homer. Please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight.
Homer Simpson: Uh... I gotta go.
Bart Simpson: As much as I hate that man right now, you gotta love that suit.

Lurleen Lumpkin: (SINGS) OH THE BASES WERE EMPTY...
Executive: Excuse me, are you Colonel Homer Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Yes I am.
Executive: I'm from Rebel Yell Records, a division of Togasaki Corp. I'm interested in buying Lurleen's contract.
Homer Simpson: Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy.
(LURLEEN'S DRESSING ROOM: int. lurleen's dressing room - a little later)
Homer Simpson: Lurleen, they loved you.
Lurleen Lumpkin: Well thank you -- I'm still a little itchy from that fiberglass hay.
Homer Simpson: Is there anything you need?
Lisa Simpson: (MOCK INNOCENCE) I'm sorry?
Lurleen Lumpkin: Well... you could make my evening complete.
Lurleen Lumpkin: What's wrong?
Homer Simpson: My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
Young Girl: Gross!
Girl: (MUFFLED) Thanks for dinner!
Pretty Girl: No!
Homer Simpson: At least could I have my dollar ba...
Marge Simpson: I'll love you for the rest of my life.
Homer Simpson: I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family.
Homer Simpson: Just so I don't wonder... You would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?
Lurleen Lumpkin: Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson: (SIGHS, PAINED) Okay.
Homer Simpson: Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen. And I'll take any offer.
Executive: I'll give you fifty bucks.
Homer Simpson: You son of a... Sold!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom)
Orville: (COUNTRY ACCENT) I caught my wife in bed with my best friend.
Hurley: (COUNTRY ACCENT) You bitter?
Orville: Yeah. Bit him too. (LAUGHS)
M.C.: (LAUGHS, THEN TURNS TO THE CAMERA) And now, once again, Lurleen.
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?
Marge Simpson: (WARMLY) Always has been.
Lurleen Lumpkin: (CHOKED UP) Now I'd like to play a song I wrote just this minute. It's called "Stand By Your Manager". (SINGS) HIS NAME IS HOMER/ HE'S QUITE A MAN/ I TRIED TO KISS HIM/ BUT HOMER RAN.

Dinosaur Dad: Would you turn off that rock 'n' rock music!
Dinosaur Son: Hey, don't have a Stegosaurus, man.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - night)
Lisa Simpson: (CHUCKLING) These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) Look Maggie, they have a baby, too.
Bart Simpson: It's like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen.
Marge Simpson: Now kids, I know you're all excited about meeting Aunt Selma's new boyfriend tonight.
Homer Simpson: Pfft.
Patty Bouvier: But I think that before he gets here, I should tell you something about him. (OMINOUS) Something... disturbing.
Lisa Simpson: Ewww.
Homer Simpson: Ooooh.
Bart Simpson: Bleuh.
Patty Bouvier: You see, Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession about not dying alone, so in desperation, she joined this prison pen-pal program. Her new sweetie's a jailbird.
Bart Simpson: Cool, he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunch tray.
Marge Simpson: Now, now, he's an ex-convict. He's paid his debt to society.
Patty Bouvier: Then how come you're not using the good silverware?
Marge Simpson: I'm just not.
Marge Simpson: That's them. Now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity.
Selma Bouvier: Everyone, I'd like you to meet --
Lisa Simpson: (SCREAM) Sideshow Bob!
Selma Bouvier: What the...?
Sideshow Bob: Selma dear, I'm afraid the children's reaction is quite understandable.
Sideshow Bob: You see, Bart here is the Shamus in short pants who sent me to prison.
Bart Simpson: That's right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery.
Homer Simpson: Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton.
Homer Simpson: Lousy snitch. (JABBING SOUND)
Bart Simpson: (WEAK LAUGH)
Sideshow Bob: (CHUCKLES) Ahh, Mr. Simpson, you're forgetting the first two noble truths of the Buddha.
Homer Simpson: I am not.
Sideshow Bob: Yes, you are. One: existence is suffering. Two: the cause of suffering is desire. In this case, my desire to do high-quality children's programming.
(Country Road: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY)
Sideshow Bob: When prison put an end to that dream, I became a seething cauldron of rage and recrimination...
(AWARDS SHOW SET: INT. AWARDS SHOW SET - EVENING)
Bart Simpson: Don't be a fool, Aunt Selma. That man is scum.
Selma Bouvier: Then call me Mrs. Scum!
Sideshow Bob: When I was nominated for best supporting performer in a children's program at the Daytime Emmy Awards, my bitterness ruined what should have been the greatest night of my life.
Krusty the Clown: And the nominees are: Droopy Drawers; Colonel Coward; Pepito the Biggest Cat in the Whole Wide World; Sideshow Bob; and Suck-up the Vacuum.
Krusty the Clown: And the Emmy goes to... (DISGRUNTLED) I don't believe this. Sideshow Bob.
(Springfield Prison: int. prison - bob's cell)
Sideshow Bob: This is one more Emmy than you'll ever win, you bantering jack-in-the-box!
Krusty the Clown: Just don't drop that thing in the shower, Bob.
Sideshow Bob: No-talent shill!
Krusty the Clown: Second banana!
Sideshow Bob: Panderer!
Krusty the Clown: Bore!
Sideshow Bob: Stop it, stop... release me... (STRUGGLING NOISES).
Krusty the Clown: (CLEARING THROAT) Now, for the highlight of the evening... Best film-to-video transfer...
Sideshow Bob: Do you know what prison is like for a life-long conservative Republican? In our over-crowded cell, we became little more than beasts.
Sideshow Bob: Who used my chapstick?
Cellmate #1: Oh, I did. Here you go.
Sideshow Bob: (TIGHTLY) I don't want it.
Sideshow Bob: My only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge against the boy who put me there...
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - dining room - present)
Bart Simpson: Aye-Carumba!
Sideshow Bob: (MENACING) Bart, if I wanted to kill you, I'd have choked you like a chicken as soon as I walked in that door.
FAMILY/EVERYONE: (GASPS)
Sideshow Bob: (CALM) But then what kind of a guest would I have been? (CHUCKLES)
Sideshow Bob: Now where was I... Ah yes, my lowest ebb.
(Springfield Prison: int. prison - sideshow bob's cell)
Sideshow Bob: (VERY UPSET) You can't take my Emmy!
Guard: Hey, you know the rules. Awards for excellence in entertainment are contraband. No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe.
Sideshow Bob: (MOANS) But kismet can be kind as well as cruel. I received an answer to my letter from the prison pen pal program.
Selma Bouvier: White.
Bart Simpson: Knock it off.
Selma Bouvier: Dear Number 24601, I need a man and I cannot find one among the law-abiding. I have a steady job, and a lucrative hobby filing nuisance law suits. I share an apartment with my twin sister. Enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike. I forget which one I am.
(Patty and Selma's Apartment: int. patty and selma's apartment - bathroom - a few days later)
Sideshow Bob: Dear Selma, your latest letter set off a riot in the maximum security wing of my heart.
Selma Bouvier: (HAPPY MOAN)
(Springfield Prison: int. prison - day)
Sideshow Bob: Like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard, our love bloomed despite all obstacles.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, may I?
Selma Bouvier: (SHAKES HEAD) Uh-uh-uh. On the cheek.
Sideshow Bob: Inspired by the love of a good woman, I resolved to be the best darned inmate Number 24601 I could be.
(Prison Gate: ext. prison gate - a few days later)
Sideshow Bob: I bade farewell to my cellmates and left with the woman I loved.
Sideshow Bob: Cutter... Ice pick... Snake, I'm going to miss you most of all.
(Simpson Home: int. SIMPSON house - DINING ROOM)
Lisa Simpson: What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob. You're living proof that our revolving door prison system works.
Marge Simpson: Selma, I've never seen you so happy. Giggling like a schoolgirl.
Selma Bouvier: (SPASMIC GUTTURAL NOISES)
Patty Bouvier: I've got to admit it, Selma. He's a once in a lifetime catch.
Sideshow Bob: Yes, I hope the police are saying that as well. (CHUCKLES)
Bart Simpson: I can't believe you guys. This man framed Krusty the Clown.
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Sideshow Bob: Indeed, I did. (EMOTIONAL) And I'd like to thank you for catching me, Bart. You seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell and pointed it straight towards the sunny shores of Selma.
Homer Simpson: Hear hear!.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, would you mind if I did something bold and shocking in front of your family?
Selma Bouvier: All right, but no tongues.
Sideshow Bob: Although kissing you would be like kissing some divine ashtray, that's not what I had in mind.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, will you marry me?
Selma Bouvier: (GASPS)
Sideshow Bob: (SIGHS) I suppose so.
Sideshow Bob: (SINGING) I KNOW I STAND IN LINE UNTIL I THINK YOU HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND AN EVENING WITH ME.
Selma Bouvier: (SINGING) AND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE TO DANCE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A CHANCE YOU WON'T BE LEAVIN' WITH ME.
Sideshow Bob: (SINGING) THEN AFTERWARDS WE DROP INTO A QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND HAVE A DRINK OR TWO.
Selma Bouvier: (SINGING) AND THEN I GO AND SPOIL IT ALL BY SAYIN' SOMETHIN' STUPID LIKE "I LOVE YOU".
Selma Bouvier: Ahhh... ahhh... Hmmmm... Could you pumice my corns for me?
Sideshow Bob: Avec plaisir.
Kindly Old Gent: A... G... Q... Seven...
Selma Bouvier: Close enough. May you drive safely and find true love.
Announcer: We now return to the Twenty-seventh Annual Krusty the Clown Telethon for Motion Sickness.
Krusty the Clown: Tiffany! (POINTING AT THE TOTE BOARD, BIG) Woo hoo! I love you people! I love my kids! (SAD) Poor little guys.
Krusty the Clown: So tragic. So nauseous. You should see the bus they came to the studio in (SOBS, THEN: CHEERFULLY) What's next? Oh yeah. And now, a man who needs no introduction -- the chairman of the company... you know who I'm talking about. Get out here, you goombah!
Crooner: Krusteleh, there's an old friend backstage who wants to say hello.
Krusty the Clown: Huh? Whuh?
Krusty the Clown: Come here you.
Sideshow Bob: Oh... oh... oh, you old clown you. (CHUCKLES)
Krusty the Clown: Oh, I missed ya.

Sideshow Bob: Krusty, can you ever forgive me for framing you and putting you in jail?
Krusty the Clown: Hey, if they ever open the books on this telethon, I'm right back in there.
Bart Simpson: That Sideshow Bob is a no-good showbiz phony.
Lisa Simpson: Come on, Bart. If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too.
Sideshow Bob: Oh Krusty, I can't tell you how much I missed this.
Marge Simpson: Now, about your wedding dress. I'm not sure how to put this...
Marge Simpson: (WRITING) White. And what would you like for appetizers?
Homer Simpson: Oooh, appetizers.
Sideshow Bob: Well Homer, you seem to be a trencherman. What should we serve?
Homer Simpson: Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!
Sideshow Bob: Well, Selma, he makes a good case.
Selma Bouvier: Get whatever you want. It all tastes like styrofoam to me.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, dear -- I'm confused.
Selma Bouvier: Well, when I was a kid we were playing with bottle rockets, and one shot straight up my nose. I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell.
Marge Simpson: Okay, we've got cocktail wienies and Swedish meatballs.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, this wedding is spinning out of control. Can we really afford it? I've already run through eight of the ten dollars they gave me when I left prison.
Selma Bouvier: Hey relax, I told ya I got money. I bought stock in a mace company just before society crumbled.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, that's wonderful. I just hope people don't think I'm marrying you for your money, instead of your... (SEARCHING) less tangible qualities.
(Park: ext. park)
Sideshow Bob: Tomorrow we'll be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Terwilliger. Isn't it grand?
Selma Bouvier: Hey, Bob. Give some of that honey this way.

Selma Bouvier: What did I miss?
Patty Bouvier: MacGyver was wearing a tank top.
Selma Bouvier: Dang.
Sideshow Bob: Why Selma, I thought I was the only man in your life.
Selma Bouvier: Sit down and shut up.
Man: Thank you, Señor MacGyver. You saved our village.
MacGyver: Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull.
Selma Bouvier: That MacGyver's a genius.
Marge Simpson: Ah, that's sweet.
Sideshow Bob: First of all he's not a genius, he's an actor. And second, he's not much of an actor.
Selma Bouvier: You're lying! You're lying!
Sideshow Bob: No Selma, this is lying: that was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to retch.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - a little later)
Selma Bouvier: He was so cruel... The things he said, they're just not true.
Marge Simpson: There, there...
Bart Simpson: Oh well, I guess the wedding's off. Fiddle dee dee, tomorrow's another day.
Marge Simpson: Bart! Stop that.
Selma Bouvier: No, he's right. We're a package. Love me, love MacGyver. (SADLY) I guess the wedding's off.
Sideshow Bob: Selma, I don't know what to say.
Selma Bouvier: Just tell me you like MacGyver.
Sideshow Bob: Very well. I... I... I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on.
Homer Simpson: Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?
Homer Simpson: Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love.
Sideshow Bob: Very well, Selma, whenever you watch MacGyver, I'll take a vigorous constitutional and return more in love with you than ever.
Selma Bouvier: Oh Bob.
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Bart no like. Bad medicine.

Selma Bouvier: ... Except for after meals and after MacGyver.
Sideshow Bob: Why Selma dear, you'll bury us all. (LITTLE CHUCKLE)
Bart Simpson: Chief Wiggum, you've been around. You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you?
Chief Wiggum: Ahh, lighten up, son. If he was going to commit a crime, would he have invited the No. 1 cop in town? (BEAT) Now, where did I put my gun? (THINKS) Oh, yeah. I set it down when I got a piece of cake...
Patty Bouvier: I don't know what to say.

Sideshow Bob: I wanted a room with a fireplace you brainless luggage monkey! Like the one in your brochure!
Sideshow Bob: Oh, Selma dear, I was just chatting with my good friend, (READS NAMETAG) Dennis. Now, smile for the camera. That's a good lad.
Sideshow Bob: (TO HIMSELF) Ah, fire: scourge of Prometheus, toaster of marshmallows, (SINISTER) eradicator of deadwood... (SEEING CAMERA) Oh Selma dear, you and your little camera. What do you say we shut it off for a while?
Selma Bouvier: And make love?
Bart Simpson: Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace?
Marge Simpson: Because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.
Bart Simpson: Romantic? With Aunt Selma?
Marge Simpson: I guess you're just too young to understand.
(Shelbyville Hotel Suite: INT. SHELBYVILLE HOTEL ROOM - DAY)

Sideshow Bob: Darling, you make it sound like a chore.
Selma Bouvier: Hmm, uh, good...
Sideshow Bob: (LOW) Soon I will kill you.
Selma Bouvier: Huh?

Sideshow Bob: My best laid plans have gang aglay!

Chief Wiggum: Well no, frankly, but that never stopped us before.
Sideshow Bob: Bart, I must know. How did you untangle my web?
Chief Wiggum: Yeah, Bart. Fill us in.
Bart Simpson: Well, I'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do his job.
Chief Wiggum: No, no, please. It's the only way I'll learn.
Bart Simpson: All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas.
Bart Simpson: Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except Aunt Selma.
Selma Bouvier: I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell.
Bart Simpson: She happily watched her MacGyver, unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas. All it needed to explode was a single spark... say, from a cigarette...
Selma Bouvier: I decided to give up smoking... except for after meals, and after MacGyver.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - an hour earlier)
Bart Simpson: Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.
Bart Simpson: Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come!
Homer Simpson: Come again?
Bart Simpson: After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way.
Homer Simpson: To the Simpson mobile!
(Hotel Room: int. hotel room - after macgyver)
Bart Simpson: Noooo!

Bart Simpson: Thanks, Mom. Now. Let's get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)

Marge Simpson: My little guy's first rock concert. I hope the Spinal Taps don't play too loud.
Homer Simpson: Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything.

Marty: Fellows, I'm gonna hit you with a phrase that has dogged you throughout your career: washed-up.
Bill: Yet here you are among the top one hundred and five concert acts today. What's your secret guys?
David: Well, after the Berlin Wall fell, our records started selling on the dismal side of the Iron Curtain, and naturally that gave us a boost.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: We're very big in Bulgaria, and wassisname, the other garia.
David: Hungaria.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Yeah, whoever.
DEREK: I can't think of anyone who's benefited more from the death of Communism than us.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Oh, maybe the people who actually live in the Communist countries.
DEREK: Oh yeah, hadn't thought of that. I bet you're right.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Yeah, on the other hand, each of us just bought out own soccer team. How many Hungarias can say that, eh?
Roadie: Test... test...
Bart Simpson: Gee, I'm sorry, man.
Stoned Guy: Huh?
Bart Simpson: About the frisbee.
Stoned Guy: Frisbee?
Bill: Say guys, I wonder if you'd mind recording a couple of promos for us.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Well, like what?
Marty: Maybe you could say, "Nobody rocks like Bill and Marty on KBBL."
David: Well, we don't know that, do we?
Nigel Bakerbutcher: What if somebody rocks as good as you?
DEREK: Or better. I mean, we don't want to look stupid.
Bill: Okay, we can respect that.
Marty: How about "Rock-a-doodle-do, you're listening to Bill and Marty."
David: Yeah, sure.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: That's good... yeah.
(CONCERT ARENA: int. conCert arena - a little later)
Crowd: Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap!
David: I just looked out, and there's puddles of water all over the freakin' stage!
Bart Simpson: I said slag off!
David: Yeah, well this is a rock concert, not the bleedin' (THINKING)...Splish Splash show!
(Arena: int. arena - a little later)
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Duff Beer, in association with Laramie Cigarettes, is proud to welcome... SPINAL TAP!
David: WE ARE THE CHILDREN WHO GREW TOO FAST...
DAVID/NIGEL: WE ARE THE DUST OF THE FUTURE PAST...
DAVID/NIGEL/DEREK: WE RAISE OUR VOICES IN THE NIGHT/ CRYING TO HEAVEN...
David: AND WILL OUR VOICES BE HEARD/ OR WILL THEY BREAK LIKE THE WIND!
David: (YELLING AT ROADIE) Medium setting!
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - continuous)
(COLISEUM: int. coliseum - later)
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Thank you!
David: All riiiight! This morning we were driving down...(DRAMATICALLY) Route 401...
Bart Simpson: That's only four miles from my house!
Nigel Bakerbutcher: And we thought they knew how to rock in Shelbyville...
DEREK: But nobody rocks like...Springfield!
Nigel Bakerbutcher: (ON MIKE, PISSED) Well, it seems some silly twit did not get a big enough oxygen pump, but that's supposed to be a devil.
David: Filled up with air, it's very evil and impressive.
DEREK: (MAKING DEVIL SALUTE) We salute you, our half-inflated Dark Lord.
DEREK: Y'know, people think there are only five members of Spinal Tap, but they're wrong.
David: (ANNOYED) Could we turn up the house lights please? That was the cue to turn up the house lights, so we can tell the audience they're the sixth member of the freakin' group.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: We are trying to put a tiny thrill into their gray little lives. Oh, forget it, turn on the lasers.
Nigel Bakerbutcher: Aagh! My vision!
Nigel Bakerbutcher: That's it. Show's over.
David: Goodnight, Springton. There will be no encores.
Milhouse Van Houten: (CHECKS WATCH) They were only on for twenty minutes!
Bart Simpson: What a gyp!
Otto Mann: Gnarly show, man.
Snake Jailbird: Wanna trash the stage?
Otto Mann: Okay.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - continuous)
Bart Simpson: Cool.

(CONCERT ARENA: int. concert arena)
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - night)
Kent Brockman: Tonight a city weeps as, for the first time ever, a hockey arena becomes a scene of violence --following a concert by Spinal Tap.
Marge Simpson: (VERY WORRIED) Hmmm, I hope my poor little baby's okay.
Lisa Simpson: (POINTING AT TV) See for yourself.
Marge Simpson: (GASPS)
Kent Brockman: Of course, it would be wrong to suggest that this sort of mayhem began with rock and roll. After all, there were riots at the premiere of Mozart's "The Magic Flute". So what's the answer? Ban all music? In this reporter's opinion the answer, sadly, is yes.
Bart Simpson: (CHEERFULLY) Hi, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Oh, oh... thank God!
Bart Simpson: Mom, I want to be a rock star.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) We'll discuss it later. Is Milhouse okay?
Homer Simpson: I'll be right back.
(CONCERT ARENA: INT. CONCERT ARENA - NIGHT)
Milhouse Van Houten: (WEAKLY) Help! Help!
(Simpson Home: INT. simpson house - MAGGIE'S ROOM - NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I've been thinking about what Bart said. If he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should BUY him A GUITAR.
Homer Simpson: Well, that's a waste of money. We already have a guitar.
Marge Simpson: I meant a real guitar.
Homer Simpson: This is real.
Bart Simpson: Wow!
Marge Simpson: And it came with a free instruction book.
Homer Simpson: Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow!
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him.
Bart Simpson: (SULLEN BRITISH ACCENT) I'd like to play me latest chart-topper. It's called "Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs."
(Hotel: int. hotel - day)
Bart Simpson: (MOANS)
Manager: Bart, you've got to go on.
Bart Simpson: Slag off!
Milhouse Van Houten: (SHAKING HEAD) You've changed, man. You used to be about the music.
Lisa Simpson: (SMUG) I'se just jammin' with you.
(EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP: int. ext. school bus stop - morning)
Nelson Muntz: Hey, Simpson, what are you trying to play?
Bart Simpson: (SMALL VOICE) Polly Wolly Doodle.
Nelson Muntz: Oh yeah, well it sounds Polly Wolly Crappy. Haw haw! Burn.
Otto Mann: Hey, cherry axe, Bart-dude.
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) I think it's broken.
Otto Mann: Oh, really? Give it here.
Bart Simpson: I didn't know you played the guitar, Otto-man!
Otto Mann: Hey, that's all I did in high school. My old man said I was wasting my time and I'd never amount to anything. (LAUGHS)
Otto Mann: (STRUMS GUITAR) Now I'd like to slow things down a little bit...
Otto Mann: (SINGING) IF I LEAVE HERE TOMORROW... WOULD YOU STILL REMEMBER ME?
(Bus: int. bus - later)
Otto Mann: (SINGING) ...CANNOT CHAEAEAEANGE... WAOWAOWAOWAOW...
Martin Prince: Although I'm sure I will receive a severe wedgie from my bus mates, I must remind you we should have been at school ten minutes ago.
Martin Prince: (LOSING HIS BALANCE) Whoooa!
Otto Mann: Uh oh. Better fasten your seatbelts, little dudes.
Lisa Simpson: We don't have seatbelts.
Otto Mann: Huh... well then, just try to go limp.
Otto Mann: (CHECKS WATCH) Better take a shortcut.

(Springfield Town Square: ext. town square - continuous)
(Skinner's Office: int. principal skinner's office - a little later)
Seymour Skinner: Oh, it's a miracle no one was hurt.
Otto Mann: I stand on my record. Fifteen crashes and not a single fatality.
Lou: Let's see your license, pal.
Otto Mann: No can do. Never got one. But if you need proof of my identity, I wrote my name on my underwear.
Otto Mann: Oh, wait, these aren't mine.
(Apartment Building: int. apartment building - hallway - nightANGLE - SKINNER)
Seymour Skinner: Well, that tears it. Until you get a license and wear your own underwear, mister, you are suspended without pay.
Otto Mann: Who's gonna drive the bus?
Seymour Skinner: I drove an all-terrain vehicle in Da Nang. I think I can handle it.
(School Bus: ext. school bus - day)
Bart Simpson: Where's Otto?
Seymour Skinner: (BITTERLY) Otto. That's one palindrome you won't be hearing for awhile.
Bart Simpson: (GASPS)
Seymour Skinner: Off we go!
Kids: HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER / HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN.
Seymour Skinner: HE DRINKS AND HE CUSSES / HE STINKS UP THE BUSSES/HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN! (SKINNER:) HA HA!
Seymour Skinner: Dum de dum... There's an opening. Too late!... Nope... Nope... That'd be cutting it a little close.
Lisa Simpson: I think you have to be more aggressive, sir.
Seymour Skinner: Nonsense. One of our good citizens will slow down and wave me in.
(Department of Motor Vehicles: ext. department of motor vehicles - establishing)
Patty Bouvier: (LAUGHS)
Selma Bouvier: What's so funny?
Patty Bouvier: I was just thinking about the time Homer got his nose caught in the toaster.
Selma Bouvier: We'll watch the tape tonight. Oh look, you've got someone at your window.
Otto Mann: (SINGING) Dododo do do do.
Patty Bouvier: My name's Patty. I'll be testing you. (POINTS TO SHIRT POCKET) When you do good, I use the green pen. When you do bad, I use the red pen. Any questions?
Otto Mann: Yeah, one. Have you always been a chick? I mean, I don't want to offend you but you were born a man, weren't you? You can tell me, I'm open-minded.
Patty Bouvier: I won't be needing this.
(SERPENTINE COURSE: ext. serpentine course - day)
Otto Mann: All right! Yeah!... So, how'd I do?
Patty Bouvier: Well, you failed every segment and misspelled "bus" on your application.
Otto Mann: Drag.

Ralph Wiggum: (SINGS) HE STEPS ON THE CLUTCH, AND THE TOILET GOES FLUSH / HAIL TO THE--
Otto Mann: Hey Landlord, some clown changed my locks, padlocked the door and put up an eviction notice.
Landlord: Yeah, that was me.
Otto Mann: You! But... but why?
Landlord: Because you haven't paid your rent.
Otto Mann: Well, can I at least get my stuff?
Landlord: All I found in there was a jar of mustard and a couple of old cycle magazines.
Otto Mann: Wow, I had mustard?
(Kwik-E-Mart: int. kwik-E-mart - DAY)
Bart Simpson: Rough day, Apu. Pump me a Squishee and don't spare the syrup.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Perhaps you'd like to try an experimental flavor of my own concoction. A delicious Chutney-Squishee.
Bart Simpson: Uh... okay.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: You can really taste the chutney.
Bart Simpson: (SOURLY) Uggh...
Otto Mann: Ow!
Bart Simpson: Otto-man?
Bart Simpson: You're living in a dumpster?
Otto Mann: Oh, man, I wish. "Dumpster" brand trash bins are top of the line. This is just a "Trash-Co" waste disposal unit.
Bart Simpson: (UPSET) Otto, why don't you come home with me? You can stay in our garage.
Otto Mann: (HAPPY) A garage?! Oh, somebody up there likes me.
Otto Mann: (MOANS)
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - night - establishing)

Otto Mann: (SINGING) I FEEL LIKE ROCKIN' SO I THINK I WILL / I'LL ROCK IT, ROCK IT, ROCK IT 'TIL I GET MY FILL... YEAH!
Otto Mann: Ooh! Hey.
Marge Simpson: Bart, what's going on?
Bart Simpson: Mom, I thought you might forget our little conversation this afternoon, so I took the precaution of recording it.
Marge Simpson: (PUZZLED) What conversation?
Bart Simpson: (ON TAPE) Mom, can Otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? (IMITATING MARGE) He sure can!
Homer Simpson: Marge, what were you thinking?
Marge Simpson: That's not my voice!
Homer Simpson: Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - 3:30 a.m.)
Marge Simpson: I don't understand this. Why can't you stay with your parents?
Otto Mann: (CHUCKLES) The admiral and I don't get along. (TO HOMER) Please let me stay here. I've got nowhere else to go.
Homer Simpson: Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.
Bart Simpson: Dad, Otto's going through a real tough time. Can't he stay with us for awhile?
Marge Simpson: I know we didn't ask for this, Homer, but doesn't the Bible say, "Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"
Homer Simpson: Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, "Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut"?
Bart Simpson: Please, Dad. If you let Otto stay, he'll help around the house, and chip in a few bucks whenever he can.
Homer Simpson: (GRUDGINGLY) All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage.
Otto Mann: (TAKEN ABACK) Wow, what's the catch?
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - day)
Tv Host: A can of corn costs... fifty-seven cents!
Otto Mann: I could sure go for a can of corn.
Marge Simpson: Otto, you can't just sit there watching TV all day.
Otto Mann: You know, you're right. I should do a little reading. (CHECKS BOOKSHELF) You got any of those "Where's Waldo" books?
Marge Simpson: No.
Otto Mann: How about anything written from the Vampire's point of view?
Marge Simpson: No.
Otto Mann: Well, how 'bout anything where guys send in naked pictures of their chicks?
Marge Simpson: Otto, I think you should get a job.
Otto Mann: Look, the only thing I was ever good at was driving a bus and now "the man" says I need a piece of paper to do that.
Marge Simpson: So get that piece of paper!
Otto Mann: I tried -- Oh, Lord, how I did try.
(GARAGE: INT. GARAGE - evening)
Homer Simpson: Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think.
Homer Simpson: That's better. (TO BART) Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?
Bart Simpson: I'll tell you the truth, Dad. I wasn't good at it right away, so I quit. I hope you're not mad.
Bart Simpson: You can do it, Otto. You're the coolest adult I ever met.
Milhouse Van Houten: Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson: (KINDLY) Son, come here. (BART GETS ON HOMER'S KNEE) Heh, heh, heh. Of course I'm not mad. If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch TV.
Bart Simpson: (SMILES) What's on?
Homer Simpson: (WARMLY) It doesn't matter.
(Simpson Bathroom: ext. simpson bathroom - morning)
Homer Simpson: Open up! Open up! I gotta go and no fooling.
Otto Mann: Hey, Pop 'N'Fresh. (BEAT) You're supposed to giggle.
Homer Simpson: (GROWLS)
Homer Simpson: (GROSSED-OUT NOISE)
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - night)
Homer Simpson: That guy has gotta go.
Marge Simpson: I know how you feel, but he is good with the kids.
Otto Mann: (DRAMATICALLY) ... So the lady drove faster, but the strange car kept banging into her from behind.
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS)
Otto Mann: So finally she swerves off the road into the woods and lost the other car. (QUIETLY) And that's when she realized the man in the other car wasn't trying to hurt her. No, he was trying to warn her... about the ax-wielding maniac hiding in her back seat!
Lisa Simpson: (PETRIFIED, TINY VOICE) Did the maniac kill her?
Otto Mann: Natch! And you know how I know?
Lisa Simpson: How?
Otto Mann: Because... (LEANS IN) I was that maniac!
Otto Mann: (ALARMED) Hey, hey, I was just kidding.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR) That's it. He's outta here.
Marge Simpson: But Homer, we're the only family he's got...
Homer Simpson: I don't care. This is not "Happy Days" and he is not the Fonz.
Otto Mann: (ENTERING) Heyyy, Mr. S...
Homer Simpson: Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house!
Otto Mann: (CRESTFALLEN) Heavy.
Bart Simpson: What are you going to do, Otto?
Otto Mann: Oh, don't worry. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who knows how to fake his own death.
Marge Simpson: Well, before you do that, maybe you should take the driving test again.
Otto Mann: (SIGHS) Oh, I can't pass that thing. I got a zero last time; this time I'm hung over.
Otto Mann: Wow! I've never been called an adult before. I've been tried as one but... (THINKS) I'll do it!
(Simpson Garage: Int. Simpson garage)
Otto Mann: (READING) "Alcohol increases your ability to drive." (READS AHEAD, THEN, SURPRISED) False? Oh, man.
(Department of Motor Vehicles: ext. DMV - day)
Otto Mann: I don't know about this Bart dude. Your dad is right, I am a bum.
Bart Simpson: He didn't call you a bum, he called you a sponge.
Otto Mann: Sponge?!
Otto Mann: Does this look like something a sponge would do (MUTTERING) I'll show him who's a sponge.
Patty Bouvier: Well, if it isn't Wee Willy Washout.
Otto Mann: I want to take the test again.
Patty Bouvier: Why?
Otto Mann: So I can staple my license to Homer Simpson's big bald head.
Patty Bouvier: (PLEASED) Really? Well, here's your written test.
Patty Bouvier: (CONSPIRATORIALLY) I'll get you started. (QUICKLY) B, C, D, A, B.
(TESTING COURSE: ext. testing course - later)
Otto Mann: Homer had a piece of food on his face for three days.
Patty Bouvier: (LAUGHS HEARTILY)
Otto Mann: It wasn't little either. It was a chicken wing.
Patty Bouvier: (LAUGHS) Wing. (LAUGHS MORE)
Otto Mann: What was that?
Patty Bouvier: It doesn't matter. Let's get some Margaritas. I'm buyin'!
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. springfield elementary - end of the day)

Milhouse Van Houten: Hey, Bart, look at this. My dad took me to Circus of Values last night and said I could get anything I wanted.
Bart Simpson: Cool! An oversized novelty billiard ball.
Milhouse Van Houten: (HOLDING UP OVERSIZED PLASTIC 8-BALL) Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the future.
Bart Simpson: (GRABBING BALL) Will I pass my English test?
Bart Simpson: (READING) "Outlook not so good." Wow! It does work!
Milhouse Van Houten: Let me try. (SHAKING 8-BALL) Will I get beat up today? (READS 8-BALL) "All signs point to yes."
Nelson Muntz: That ball knows everything. (UGH)
Bart Simpson: Hey, I got a good one. (TALKS TO 8-BALL) Will Milhouse and I be friends till we're toothless old men with hair coming out of our ears? READING BALL, SURPRISED) "Don't count on it." Will Milhouse and I be friends when we're high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? (SHAKES, READS 8-BALL) "It looks doubtful." (WORRIED) Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day?
Bart Simpson: What could come between two bestest buddies like us?
(Springfield Elementary School: int. Springfield elementary - skinner's office - continuous)
Seymour Skinner: Samantha I've always been suspicious of transfer students... Other principals try to unload problem cases that way... Lord knows I do.
Samantha Stanky: I'm a good student, Principal Skinner.
Seymour Skinner: (SKEPTICAL) Yeah sure, and they told me I'd get a big parade when I got back from 'Nam. Instead they spat on me. I can still feel it searing. (UPBEAT) So, now let's just see what the permanent record has to say, shall we?
Seymour Skinner: Hmm... no detention... fairly good attendance record... Oh, I see you beat that bed wetting problem in the second grade.
Samantha Stanky: That's in there?
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLES) Don't worry. They'll forget. (SEETHING) Just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for eighteen agonizing months. Every night I'd wake up screaming. (THEN, UPBEAT) Well, let's meet your classmates.
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey Bart, was this thing right about your test?
Bart Simpson: To those who doubt the power of the Magic 8-Ball, I say "Behold my "F!"
Seymour Skinner: (CLEARS THROAT) Attention class, I have a new student for you.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Great, another student. Just keep packing 'em in, Seymour.
Seymour Skinner: I think we should discuss this later, Edna. (TO CLASS) Now, it's never easy to come to a new school, so let's make her feel right at home. Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky.
Samantha Stanky: Stanky.
Seymour Skinner: Oh, right. How embarrassing for you. Well, goodbye.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I'm sure this is a little scary for you, dear.
Samantha Stanky: (SMALL VOICE) Uh-huh.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: So why don't you stand up in front of the class and tell us about yourself? I'll be grading you on grammar and poise.
Samantha Stanky: We just moved here from Phoenix. My Dad owns a home security company. He came to Springfield because of its high crime rate and lackluster police force. All my friends are back in Phoenix, and this town has a weird smell that you're all probably used to -- but I'm not.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: It'll take you about six weeks, dear.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet willie?
Milhouse Van Houten: Sure.
Milhouse Van Houten: Eew!
Bart Simpson: (CHUCKLING) Victim number four. (CALLING OFF) Hey, Lewis, can I interest you in a wet willie?
Lewis Clark: Sure!
Milhouse Van Houten: (MOANS)
Milhouse Van Houten: When I find out who hit me with that ball... I'm gonna tear 'em a new...
Milhouse Van Houten: (STUNNED) Wuh.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Class, in order to explain why your hormones will soon make you an easy target for every smooth talking Lothario with his own car and tight jeans, I will now show a short sex education film.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Ezekiel and Ismail, in accordance with your parents' wishes, you may step out into the hall and pray for our souls.
(CLASSROOM: int. classroom - continuous)
Bart Simpson: Bo-ring!
Kids: Eew!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: She's faking it.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (BORED) Any questions?
Nelson Muntz: Mrs. Krabappel, how come you don't live with Mr. Krabappel?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Because Mr. Krabappel chased something small and fluffy down a rabbit hole.
Samantha Stanky: How do we know when we fall in love?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Oh, don't you worry. Most of you will never fall in love and marry out of fear of dying alone. (CHUCKLES)
Bart Simpson: How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I'm sorry, that would be playing God.
Bart Simpson: God shmod, I want my monkey-man.
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. school - afternoon)
Milhouse Van Houten: Ah, that's a nice dress.
Samantha Stanky: My dad makes me wear it. I hate it.

Samantha Stanky: Okay.
(Bus: INT. BUS - THAT MOMENT)
Otto Mann: Everybody on, but no shoving. (BEAT) Just kiddin', you can shove all you want.

(Bart's Treehouse: int. treehouse - day)
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, what a pleasant surprise.
Samantha Stanky: Hi.
Bart Simpson: (ANGRY) Hey, what's with the skirt?
Milhouse Van Houten: I've brought friends to this treehouse before.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, but never a girl. What if I want to strut around nude?
Samantha Stanky: Maybe I should go.
Homer Simpson: So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories.
(POOL: ext. pool - day)
Bart Simpson: No, that's okay. You can stay. You can read comics with us. (DIGGING THROUGH PILE) Let's see, something for the lady...ah, "Radioactive Man Vs. the Swamp Hag.
Samantha Stanky: Got any girl comics? Like "Bonnie Craine, Girl Attorney," "Punkin & Duncan, the Twinkle Twins," or "L'il Kneesocks?"
Bart Simpson: No, but my sister's got a wide selection of crappy comics.
Bart Simpson: (GROSSED OUT NOISE) you guys wanna see something gross?
Bart Simpson: (GASPS)
Announcer: Tonight on Smartline -- "I'm Okay, You're Too Fat". Here's your host, Kent Brockman.
Kent Brockman: Good evening. Did you know that thirty-four million American adults are obese? Taken together, that excess blubber could fill the Grand Canyon two-fifths of the way up. That may not sound impressive, but keep in mind it is a very big canyon.
(Simpson Home: int. SIMPSON HOUSE - living room - night)
Homer Simpson: This sucks. Where is that channel changer?
Homer Simpson: (SEVERAL FEEBLE GRUNTS) Oh, eh, I'll give it a chance.
Kent Brockman: Americans have grown up with the image of the jolly fat man. Dom DeLuise, Alfred Hitchcock, and of course, Santa Claus. But in real life, Santa would be suffering from gallstones, hypertension, impotence, and diabetes.
Marge Simpson: (SOBBING) I wish they had never invented fried cheese!
Grave Digger: We've got to widen the hole.
Crane Operator: (WISE GUY VOICE) Well, make it snappy. The chain's startin' to give!
Female Announcer: (SEDUCTIVELY) We take eighteen ounces of sizzling ground beef and soak it in rich creamery butter. Then we top it off with bacon, ham and a fried egg. We call it the "Good Morning Burger!"
Homer Simpson: (SHUDDERS IN AWE)
Lisa Simpson: I gotta help him.
(Bart's Treehouse: int. tree house - day)
Samantha Stanky: (LOUD KISSING NOISES)
Bart Simpson: Okay, Milhouse... I'll trade your Carl Yastrzemski baseball card for my Omar Vizquel.
Bart Simpson: Deal! Next on the trading block, your Mickey Mantle -- 1958, mint condition -- for my picture of Homer on the couch.
Samantha Stanky: Milhouse, I gotta go.
Samantha Stanky: My dad thinks I'm having my braces examined.
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, you kinda-sorta are. (CHUCKLES)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, we're living in the age of cooties. I can't believe the risk you're running. Besides, what's so great about kissing?
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, it's not just the kissing. A lot of it is waitin' to kiss. You know like when you open an Eskimo Pie and you wait just a little bit for it to melt?
Bart Simpson: But she doesn't melt.
Milhouse Van Houten: (SMOOTHLY) Oh yes she does!
Female Announcer: (SEDUCTIVELY) We start with pure milk chocolate...
Homer Simpson: Chocolate...
Female Announcer: Add a layer of farm-fresh honey...
Homer Simpson: Ooh, sweet.
Female Announcer: Then we sprinkle on four kinds of sugar...
Female Announcer: And dip it in rich creamery butter.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, what if I told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?
Homer Simpson: I'd say "You're a lying scumbag." Why sweetie?
Lisa Simpson: According to Eternity Magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. That's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
Homer Simpson: Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter.
Lisa Simpson: They'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. As you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less.
Homer Simpson: Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge?

Bart Simpson: (GLUM) He has a girlfriend.
Marge Simpson: Milhouse? (GIGGLES)

Bart Simpson: Listen Martin, right now I'm looking for a friend who won't leave me for a girl.
Martin Prince: That's me. I'm just as unpopular with the ladies as I am with the chaps.
Bart Simpson: (QUICKLY) Yeah, right. Anyway... do you want to do something after school?

Marge Simpson: I don't know if that tape is working. You ate three desserts tonight.
Homer Simpson: Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
Marge Simpson: (PUZZLED) There's another thing I've been wanting to talk to you about...
Homer Simpson: Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!

Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Bart Simpson: Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't the three of us go spit on the Principal's car?
Milhouse Van Houten: Listen, Bart... there's such a thing as spendin' too much time together.
Bart Simpson: (BEAT) Oh. Fine. I'm tired of watching you two lip wrestle. There's plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town.
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, wait!
Bart Simpson: (HOPEFUL) Yeah?
Milhouse Van Houten: Uh... can we still use your tree house?
Bart Simpson: What? Get bent.
Milhouse Van Houten: If her father catches us -- he'll kill her.
Bart Simpson: All right, Milhouse. You can use my tree house. (SLY)

Mr. Stanky: Samantha, you're my little girl and sometimes my imagination runs away with me. Just, just tell me what happened.
Samantha Stanky: Well, Milhouse and I --
Mr. Stanky: That's enough! I'm putting you in an all girls school. You're never going to see that boy again.
Samantha Stanky: Milhouse!
Milhouse Van Houten: Samantha!
Bart Simpson: Well Milhouse, "'Tis better to have loved and lost"... yada yada yada... let's go to the arcade.

Bart Simpson: Five fingers? Ew, freak show. (BEAT) Listen, Lis. I need some advice and mom's not here.
Lisa Simpson: Why didn't you go to dad?
Bart Simpson: I did, but I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying. Lisa, I feel terrible. I ratted on my best friend and he doesn't even know I did it.
Lisa Simpson: (FLIPPING PAGES) Well, according to "Eternity" magazine, the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine. Dow chemical is developing a minty gel, which will eliminate excess guilt, but unfortunately it won't be on the market for another six months. So I guess you're gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to Milhouse.

Milhouse Van Houten: Well, I didn't want you to see me cry this time.
(MEDICAL TESTING AREA: int. medical testing area)

Samantha Stanky: Milhouse!
Milhouse Van Houten: Samantha, I went to Circus of Values to buy you a ten gallon tub of Gummy Bears.
Bart Simpson: Hey Samantha, I'm sorry about gettin' you thrown in the penguin house.
Samantha Stanky: (SOUNDING BORN AGAIN) That's all right, Bart. I love Saint Sebastian's. It's run by a group of French Canadian nuns. They're very nice, except they never let me out.

Waylon Smithers: Sir, I'm afraid Homer Simpson is sterile.
C. Montgomery Burns: Who?
Waylon Smithers: One of your cabbage heads from Sector 7-G. Take a look at this sperm sample from his recent physical.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ewww.
Waylon Smithers: Now, compare this with a normal sperm sample.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hm. Oh yes.
Waylon Smithers: I'm afraid radiation from the plant is the reason he's shooting blanks. He could sue us for millions.

Lawyer: I'll have some coffee.
C. Montgomery Burns: Want it black, don't you? Black like your heart! It's so hard for me to listen to you, I hate you all so much... I'm sorry. It's my problem. I'll deal with it. Please continue.
Lawyer: If you offer Mr. Simpson a token sum -- say, a couple thou -- he'll be so dazzled, he'll sign anything you shove under his nose.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SNEERING) Oh, brilliant. A cash settlement. I could have figured that out, you button-down maggot.

HERB: Forbes Magazine called it the "Blunder of the Century." A little overblown, don't you think? What about new Coke?
WILLIAM POWEL LOOKALIKE: Hey, I invented that.
HERB: Yeah, but all that's in the past. Because this is America and in America you're never finished as long as you've got a brain in your head. Because all a man really needs is an idea.

Bart Simpson: (INNOCENT) We were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise.
Lisa Simpson: (DRAMATIC) We leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
Bart Simpson: There, there. You're safe now, little sister.

Homer Simpson: (SUSPICIOUS) Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it.
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISGUSTED NOISE) All right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence!

Homer Simpson: (SADLY) I miss my couch.
Smokin' Joe Frazier: I know how you feel. You lost a couch. I lost a heavyweight championship.
Homer Simpson: Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind.
Smokin' Joe Frazier: Homer, I know things are tough now. But one day you'll be walking along and you'll see a piece of furniture that you can love just as much.
Barney Gumble: Hey, Frazier, shut up!
Smokin' Joe Frazier: Barney, you've been riding my back all night.

Lisa Simpson: Dad? Dad?
Homer Simpson: (BEING VIBRATED) I'll take it.
Marge Simpson: This chair is $2,000. We could buy a whole living room set for that.
Homer Simpson: Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer.
Marge Simpson: This money was a blessing. We can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
Homer Simpson: All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky.

Lisa Simpson: (JOYOUSLY) Unky Herb!
HERB: Bart... Lisa. I'm so glad to see you.
Homer Simpson: (RUBBING JAW) You weren't so glad to see me.
HERB: I'm sorry, Homer. But I'm still mad at you. Every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face.
Homer Simpson: Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?
HERB: I'll try, but I'm not making any promises.
Marge Simpson: (GASPS) Herb! How have you been?
HERB: I've been living in a cardboard box, sleeping on grates, eatin' out of dumpsters. You?
Marge Simpson: Can't complain.
Homer Simpson: Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode.

Marge Simpson: I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel.
Homer Simpson: They do good work.
Bart Simpson: Unky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?
HERB: Discarded pizza boxes are an inexpensive source of cheese.
HERB: Lisa, aren't you happy to see me?
Lisa Simpson: Why didn't you write, Unky Herb?
HERB: Hey if I wrote to you what was I supposed to say? "Dear Lisa, last night I used a rat for a pillow thanks to your pop.
Lisa Simpson: I see your point.
HERB: (SINGS SOFTLY) "WHETHER YOU'RE DRIVING NEAR OR FAR / POWELL MAKES A POW-POW-POWERFUL CAR!" (CHUCKLES)
HERB: Maggie, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. You're gonna make me rich again. (BABY TALK) Yes-oo are! Yes-oo are!
HERB: One, two, three... Ventnor Avenue.
Lisa Simpson: And while on Ventnor Avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. Of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill.
HERB: Get to the point.
Lisa Simpson: (MERCILESS) Eleven hundred and fifty bones.
HERB: That's all I got.
Homer Simpson: (AMUSED) Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. (CHUCKLES) I guess you're just not much of a businessman.
Homer Simpson: (MOAN)
Marge Simpson: Maybe we should play another game.
Bart Simpson: Why are we playin' games when we got two grand in the bank!? Remember when Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence?
Lisa Simpson: Well, I think we should invest in a set of the great books of Western Civilization. Look at this ad from "New Republic for Kids." Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: "Paradise Regained," "Martin Chuzzlewit," or Herman Melville's twin classics "Omoo" and "Typee".
Homer Simpson: Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?
Marge Simpson: That was your idea.
Bart Simpson: I think we should get a machine gun. We could use it to hunt game, spell out things, or ring in the new year!
Marge Simpson: Well, I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer.
HERB: How would you like to spend two thousand dollars to give a broken man a second chance?
Homer Simpson: Nah.
Marge Simpson: Homer, wait. Herb, what're you talking about?
HERB: Up-up-up-up. Not here. Come into the dining room. I want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world.
Homer Simpson: (WHINY) Twenty minutes?! (MOAN)
HERB: Okay. Now, before I tell you about my idea, I'd like to show you this.
Homer Simpson: (POINTING) It's drinking the water!
HERB: Take it easy, Homer. Now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed...
Homer Simpson: This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!
HERB: (PATIENTLY) No, Homer. That invention is out already. I'm just using it as an example.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) It's going back for more!
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED SOUND)
HERB: Homer, this is my invention.
HERB: Now, of course, with these blueprints you'll have to use your imagination.
Lisa Simpson: (COVERING FACE) Maggie! Maggie!
HERB: It's a baby translator. It measures the pitch, the frequency, and the urgency of a baby's cries. Then it tells whoever's around -- in plain English -- exactly what the baby is trying to say. Everything from "Change me" to "turn off that damn Raffi record."
Marge Simpson: (IMPRESSED) That's a very clever idea!
HERB: All I need is a couple thousand dollars to build a prototype. You'll have your money back in thirty days. I swear.
Lisa Simpson: I think we owe a debt to Unky Herb. He took us into his home and Dad destroyed him.
Bart Simpson: Dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother.
Homer Simpson: All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother.
HERB: Nope.
Homer Simpson: Okay, then just give me the drinking bird.
HERB: Now, let's see... What could you be trying to say? (CHECKING MAGGIE'S DIAPER) Nothing downstairs... You just took a nap...
HERB: (HOLDING NOSE) "I want to suck your nose."
HERB: Ooga booga! Ooga booga!
HERB: (WRITING ON CLIPBOARD) "I'm scared."
HERB: Hmm... the amplitude of the sine wave is insufficient for "Burp Me", and this saw-tooth formation is something I've never...
HERB: Eureka.
HERB: Now, I bet you're all wondering what lies under this sheet.
Bart Simpson: Not really. We peeked inside while you were in the john.
HERB: Oh. Well, here it is again. My "Baby Translator!"
Marge Simpson: (TOO BIG) Whoooa!!
HERB: Marge, you don't have to humor me.
Marge Simpson: Well, it's pretty ingrained.
HERB: What do you think, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks.
HERB: Homer, could you stop thinking about your ass!
Homer Simpson: I try, but I can't.
Herb Powell: (THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) Lavish attention on me and entertain me.
Marge Simpson: (GASPS) Maggie, you talked!
HERB: You see! It tells you exactly what's on the baby's mind.
Homer Simpson: (PHEW) Never mind.
Herb Powell: (THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) Where did you go?
Lisa Simpson: Peek-a-boo!
Herb Powell: (THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) Oh, there you are. Very amusing.
HERB: Well, Homer, now what do you think?
Homer Simpson: I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something.
Marge Simpson: Homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these.
Herb Powell: (THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) I have soiled myself. How embarrassing.
Homer Simpson: I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
Marge Simpson: Don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. He is your brother.
Homer Simpson: Well, when is he gonna act like it?

HERB: This is what you get, Homer. I forgive you. You can call me brother and I can do the same.
Homer Simpson: That's it?
HERB: That's it.
Homer Simpson: (SINCERELY) I see your point, brother.

Marge Simpson: (REMINDING HOMER) Homie, you do remember your promise to the children?
Homer Simpson: (CHEERFULLY) Sure do. (TO KIDS) When you're eighteen, you're out the door.
Lisa Simpson: No, Dad. You promised if Bart and I got C averages we could go to Kamp Krusty. And with no false modesty, (POINTS TO SELF) you're looking at one happy camper.
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS) Yeah. Well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. It now goes: D,B,A,C.
Homer Simpson: Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty.
Bart Simpson: But Dad...

Homer Simpson: You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy.
Bart Simpson: (CRYING) So I won't get to go to camp?
Homer Simpson: Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn't. But why should you pay for my mistake?
Bart Simpson: You mean I can go?
Homer Simpson: Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
Bart Simpson: Oh, Dad. You're the best father a boy could ever have!
Homer Simpson: Thanks son. (RUBBING BART'S HAIR) Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?

Marge Simpson: (SHARPLY) I'm sure you won't enjoy it. There's nothing about bowling in the play... Oh wait, there is.
Homer Simpson: Probably not much of it.
Marge Simpson: Why can't you be a little more supportive?
Homer Simpson: Because I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects.

Marge Simpson: We're talking about Bart.
Homer Simpson: Oh. That guy.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I think the problem here is discipline. If Bart does something wrong you should punish him.
Marge Simpson: Well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in.
Homer Simpson: (CHEERFUL) He's the boy you love to hate.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well, you've got to start being firm with him. I believe with persistent discipline even the poorest student can end up becoming... oh... say Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

Homer Simpson: But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present.
Marge Simpson: (EXASPERATED SIGH) Please, Homer. Why do I always have to be the bad guy?

Bart Simpson: (PATTING POCKET WITH TICKET CLEARLY VISIBLE) I got my ticket.
Kent Brockman: I'm here live in Korea to give you a first hand look at how American cartoons are made. But first, let's take a look back at the year 1928. A year when you might have seen Al Capone dancing the Charleston on top of a flagpole.
Kent Brockman: It was also the year of the very first Scratchy cartoon, entitled "That Happy Cat".
Homer Simpson: Sorry, but the punishment stands.
Kent Brockman: The film did very poorly. But the following year Scratchy was teamed up with a psychotic young mouse named Itchy. And cartoon history was made. Here's their first cartoon together: "Steamboat Itchy."
Itchy: Oh me, oh my!
Kent Brockman: During the war Itchy & Scratchy put their differences aside and teamed up to fight a bigger foe.
Kent Brockman: We'll be back with a real life Itchy & Scratchy. A rabid mouse in Boston who attacked and killed a small cat. (CHUCKLES)

Bart Simpson: Come on, go nuts.
Homer Simpson: Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?

Bart Simpson: Not bloody likely.

Bart Simpson: Dad, what's the point of this story?

Lisa Simpson: It wasn't that great.
Bart Simpson: Be honest.

Homer Simpson: Don't you think I know that?
Marge Simpson: Well, it's been two months. You laid down the law and I'm proud of you. But I think we've gotten through to him.
Homer Simpson: Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a "Mister Tight Buns" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen.

So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time... now to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. "Give me five bees for a quarter" you'd say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time.

C. Montgomery Burns: Hi, Dr. Nick!
Homer Simpson: Oof.
Bart Simpson: And sometimes I got into trouble...
Dr. Nick Riviera: Oh, dear. I see no signs of life. Just to be safe, we better pull the plug.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yoink.
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns, how can you be so cold- hearted?
C. Montgomery Burns: (SMOLDERING) You have no idea, woman, what that man's put me through.

Professor Jonathan Frink: I have an unorthodox solution: a "fantastic voyage", if you will. (CHUCKLES) Three scientists... One a beautiful woman... will be shrunk to microscopic size. They will then rendezvous in Mr. Simpson's lower colon --

Bart Simpson: Cartoons have writers?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, sort of.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah, well you and I could write a better cartoon than that.

(Cartoon Barber Shop: int. cartoon barber shop)
Lisa Simpson: Scratchy is getting a haircut. Then Itchy -- the barber -- chops Scratchy's head off with a razor!

Lisa Simpson: Finished. Now all we have to do is put our names on it.

Gary: No we didn't.
Homer Simpson: Oh. Then I learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.
Lisa Simpson: No you didn't. You only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong.
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) Hmmm, true.
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) And I learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you're gonna take that course over again without cheating.

Burns' Mother: (CALLING) Happy! Come here, Happy!
7-YEAR OLD BURNS: Yes, Momsie?
Burns's Father: Happy, would you like to continue living with us, your loving natural parents? Or would you rather live with this twisted loveless billionaire?
7-YEAR OLD BURNS: Let's roll.
Burns's Father: Wait! You forgot your bear! A symbol of your lost youth and innocence!
Burns's Father: (SIGHS) Oh well. At least we still have his little brother George.
Charlie: Hm... I wonder what makes it turn?
George Burns: Ba-ba-ba-ba. Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home. Ba-ba-ba-ba trust me, it'll be funny when I'm an old man.
C. Montgomery Burns: I want my teddy!
C. Montgomery Burns: (IN HIS SLEEP) Bobo! Bo-Bo! Oh, it's you. The bedpan's under my pillow.
Waylon Smithers: (SLIGHT EDGE TO HIS VOICE) Who's Bobo, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: Bobo? (LYING) I meant Lobo. Sheriff Lobo. They never should have canceled that show.

Homer Simpson: (SCREAMS)
Marge Simpson: What? Homie!
Homer Simpson: Oh no! Burns' Birthday!
Marge Simpson: What's wrong?
Homer Simpson: (LOW WHINING) Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.
C. Montgomery Burns: Where is that dreaded piñata?
Homer Simpson: Ow. Ow. Ow. Missed me. (LAUGHS) Ow!
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED SOUND)
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. power PLANT - later)

C. Montgomery Burns: That man who's getting all those laughs, Smithers. Who is he?
Waylon Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir. One of the carbon blobs from Sector 7G. But I don't think...
C. Montgomery Burns: (RUBBING HANDS TOGETHER) I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life.
Waylon Smithers: Fine, sir. I'll get him started on some snappy Sinbad-esq material.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - day)
Homer Simpson: (AS HE WRITES) Hee hee! I'm so funny! This is gonna be great.
Marge Simpson: What are you doin'?
Homer Simpson: I'm writing a delicious send up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poo poo one word or two?
Bart Simpson: (CRACKING UP)
Carl Carlson: Who cares?
Marge Simpson: I don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.
Lisa Simpson: Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart.
Homer Simpson: Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. (CHUCKLES) I paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGH)
Lisa Simpson: (VERY WORRIED MURMUR)
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson home - that night)
Homer Simpson: (SWAGGERING) Now I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...
Bart Simpson: Incontinent... Too rich.
Lisa Simpson: Does either of you know what incontinent means?
Homer Simpson: Lisa, don't spoil our fun!
Marge Simpson: Come on dear. It's time to go.
Homer Simpson: (JOVIAL) Okay, stupid!
Marge Simpson: Homer! You've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss.
Homer Simpson: Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. Hey Flanders, you smell like Manure!
Ned Flanders: Uh-oh. Better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose-news, neighbor.

C. Montgomery Burns: Eh, no time. Next!
(NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BALLROOM: Int. nuclear power plant ballroom - a little later)
Waylon Smithers: (A LITTLE SUBDUED) I have some sad news to report. A small puppy, not unlike Lassie was just run over in the parking lot.

Homer Simpson: (LOTS OF ENERGY) Are you ready to laugh?
Man: Oh... That poor dog.
Homer Simpson: I said are you ready to laugh?!
Woman: Quiet, you awful man!
Homer Simpson: (SMOOTHLY) You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap...
C. Montgomery Burns: What!
Homer Simpson: (SUDDENLY NERVOUS) I mean... you know... Mr. Burns... is so... old...
C. Montgomery Burns: How dare you!
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky.

Homer Simpson: I think I'm so big. Blah, blah, blah.

Lisa Simpson: I'd like to believe that this time. I really would.
Marge Simpson: Bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father.
Bart Simpson: Yes'm. (CHUCKLES TO HIMSELF) Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can.
Homer Simpson: Don't worry, boy. He'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday.
Lisa Simpson: I knew it.
(Burns's Warehouse: INT. BURNS' WAREHOUSE - A LITTLE LATER)
Bart Simpson: Dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he'll pay.
Waylon Smithers: Look at all the wonderful things you have, Mr. Burns. King Arthur's Excalibur. The only existing nude photo of Mark Twain, and that rare first draft of the constitution with the word "suckers" in it.
C. Montgomery Burns: (IMPATIENTLY) Yes, yes, yes. So what?
Waylon Smithers: You want your bear, Bobo, don't you?
C. Montgomery Burns: (SNAPPING) Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! (BEAT - ADMITTING) Resistance is futile. Oh God, how I only want my bear. But he's gone. Gone forever. (SIGHS) I'd give anything to know what happened to him.
Mechanic: Put some grease in your garter, Lindy! You're late.
Hitler: This is all your fault!
Explorer: You've got to start selling this for more than a dollar a bag. We lost four more men on this expedition.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: If you can think of a better way to get ice, I'd like to hear it.
(Kwik-E-Mart: INT. Kwik-E-Mart)
Bart Simpson: Hey, Apu, this bag of ice has a head in it.

Kent Brockman: The Burns Bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the world, could be anywhere. It could be in your house. You could be looking at it right now.
Kent Brockman: It could be right in front of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one.
Homer Simpson: Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down.
Homer Simpson: Moldy!?! Old!?!... (EXCITED) I'm gonna get something to eat!
(Burns Manor: EXT. BURNS MANSION)
Homer Simpson: Right. That makes sense. (BEAT)
Homer Simpson: No! (SCREAMS) Lemme go!

Lisa Simpson: (READING) "Bobo". It's Mr. Burns' bear all right.
Homer Simpson: Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio.
Homer Simpson: Two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun... (DROOLS)
Voice: Homer, you're drooling on the mic again.
Lisa Simpson: I think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much.
Marge Simpson: (LOOKS AT BEAR) Hmm, better sew that eye back on.
Bart Simpson: No. Let's send Burns the eye in the mail. He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger.
Homer Simpson: Yes. We'll send the eye.
Marge Simpson: (REASONABLY) I'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward. (SUDDENLY) And then we'll make him double it.
Marge Simpson: Well why can't I be greedy once in awhile?
(Burns Manor: Int. burns' mansion)
C. Montgomery Burns: Bobo! My beautiful Bobo! I promise I'll never leave you behind again.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, yes. Naturally I can't pay you much of a reward because... I'm strapped for cash.
C. Montgomery Burns: As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But I'm sure we can come to an understanding.
Homer Simpson: Yes sir. (TO HIMSELF) Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.
C. Montgomery Burns: May I offer you a drink?
Homer Simpson: (WITH GREAT FINALITY) Sorry, Burns. No deal.

Grampa Simpson: Son! You've gotta help me! I hit three people on the way over here, and I don't have any insurance. (THEN CALM) So, hows 'bout you?

C. Montgomery Burns: What's that you say? You can live without television as long as you have beer?
Homer Simpson: That's right.

C. Montgomery Burns: Well, Maggie, I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement.
C. Montgomery Burns: Beaten by an infant. What could be more humiliating?
Carl Carlson: Well, there were a few left but we chucked them at an old man for kicks.
C. Montgomery Burns: Okay, Maggie, you win. But I want you to do something for me. Hang on to that bear. Don't make the same mistake I made.
C. Montgomery Burns: For me? Bobo? (GASP) Smithers, I'm so happy. Something amazing has happened. I'm actually happy. Take a note. From now on, I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone.

(BURNS' CASTLE: int. burns' castle - secret stairwell - a little later)

Marge Simpson: Ruth, I've done a lot of thinking, and I really consider you a friend. And an important part of friendship is...

Kearney Zzyzwicz: See you tomorrow, loser.

Lisa Simpson: (GASPS)
Bart Simpson: Cool!
Lisa Simpson: (PROUD) I always knew some day Mom would violently rise up, and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors.
Bart Simpson: Eh, shut your yap.
Kent Brockman: At the risk of editorializing, these women are guilty, and must be dealt with in a harsh and brutal fashion. Otherwise, their behavior could incite other women, leading to anarchy of biblical proportions. (RANTING) It's in Revelations, people!
(Ruth's Car: Int. Ruth's car - nearing sunset)
RUTH: (POINTING TO A SIGN) Look! We're only two miles from the state line. We're gonna make it, we're gonna be okay.
Marge Simpson: My God! That must be every policeman in Springfield!
RUTH: That's it, I give up. A single mother can't win in a man's world.
Marge Simpson: Ruth, that's a lot of hooey. It's not over until it's over.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, I should have asked first.
RUTH: No Marge, you did it! We really are gonna make it now.
Chief Wiggum: Oh no, they're headed right for the Grand Chasm.
Homer Simpson: Oh my God. They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault!
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULL HORN) Marge! Marge!
Marge Simpson: Homer?!
Homer Simpson: Look, Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband. I'm sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub. I'm sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car... And I'm sorry... Oh well let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point.
Marge Simpson: (TO RUTH) You're right. I am lucky to have him.
Homer Simpson: But please Marge, don't drive into that chasm!

(Simpson Kitchen: Int. Simpson kitchen - morning)
Lisa Simpson: Quit it, Bart. (OFF OF EACH FACE) Quit it. Quit it. Quit it. Mom, Bart's making faces.
Marge Simpson: Stop that, Bart. Homer, speak to him.
Homer Simpson: Heh. Heh. Stupid animals.
Homer Simpson: Ahh, the daily newspaper.
Homer Simpson: Oooh! The Springfield Men's Shelter is giving away sixty soiled mattresses!
Marge Simpson: Why do you read that "Free" column, Homer? They never have anything good.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) OH MY GOD!
Lisa Simpson: What is it?
Homer Simpson: (TOO EXCITED TO SPEAK) Tram...Ample...Een! Tram...Baple...Een!

Homer Simpson: (AMUSED) (CHUCKLES)
Krusty the Clown: Hey! That seltzer ain't free.
Homer Simpson: (SURPRISED) Krusty!
Krusty the Clown: That's me. (LAUGH) You here for the trampoline?
Homer Simpson: Yeah. What's the deal?
Krusty the Clown: Well, I used to do a lot of tumbling in my act, but I'm phasing it out for more dirty limericks. (RECITING) There once was a man named Enos --

Bart Simpson: (THRILLED) I can't believe it!

Bart Simpson: Look at me! / (AD LIB WHOOPS AND LAUGHTER)
Bart Simpson: I will never get tired of this.
Lisa Simpson: I'm going to have my wedding here.
Marge Simpson: I don't know if this is a good idea.
Homer Simpson: Marge, it's the perfect exercise. It'll double the value of our house. And it was free. FREEEE!!
Marge Simpson: Are you sure it's safe?
Homer Simpson: Absolutely! And this is just the beginning! I've got some big plans.
Milhouse Van Houten: It smells funny in there.

Todd Flanders: Catch me, Lord! Catch me!
Rod Flanders: What have we done to make God angry?
Todd Flanders: You did it!
Milhouse Van Houten: (MAD) Stop jumping on me! I'm hurt!
Homer Simpson: Kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump.
Marge Simpson: Homer, this is terrible!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED) Okay, okay. I'll take care of it.
Marge Simpson: (NAGGING) I told you this was a bad idea!
Homer Simpson: All right, all right! I'll get rid of the trampoline!
(Street: Ext. street)
Homer Simpson: (CALLING) Hey, Krusty! I'm bringing back the...
Krusty the Clown: (DEADLY TONE) You just keep right on drivin'.
Homer Simpson: There we go. (DUSTS HANDS)
Homer Simpson: That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.
Homer Simpson: Yep, it's finally gone.
Homer Simpson: If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now.
Homer Simpson: I'm thirsty.
Homer Simpson: (YELLS)
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - front yard)
Homer Simpson: Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline.
Homer Simpson: (SLUMPING) All right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust.
Homer Simpson: Rust I tell ya. (CRAZED LAUGH)
Bart Simpson: Dad. Dad! You really want to get rid of this trampoline?
Homer Simpson: Uh-huh.
Bart Simpson: Observe - a bike lock.
Bart Simpson: Now just turn around and count to three.
Bart Simpson: One, two, three.
Bart Simpson: Uh, better make it five.
Snake Jailbird: All right, I got me a bed.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Shh! Quiet! You'll wake up Ol' Man Simpson.
Jimbo Jones: Hey, no more trampoline.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Let's jump on the car instead.
Homer Simpson: Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. (THEN, DEFIANT) But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things. If it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!
Marge Simpson: (COLDLY) That's not true.
Homer Simpson: Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
Marge Simpson: I can name ten things! I... (STUMPED) I made sloppy Joes...
Homer Simpson: (SNORTS) That's not fun!
(Simpson Living Room: Int. Simpson living room - next day)
Marge Simpson: Kids. Tell me the truth. Am I no fun? Do I just nag all the time?
Lisa Simpson: (UNCOMFORTABLE) Um... Uh, well... Uh...
Homer Simpson: See, Marge?
Marge Simpson: (STIFFLY) I didn't realize people saw me that way.
Lisa Simpson: Are you mad?
Marge Simpson: (QUIETLY SEETHING) No. I'm fine. I'm going to my sisters' now.

Selma Bouvier: (EYING VIAL) And I don't like this urine sample one bit.
Patty Bouvier: You're headed for a nervous breakdown. You need Brad Goodman.
Selma Bouvier: His infomercial plays round-the-clock on channel 77.
GOODMAN: Thank you, Martha Quinn. (TO CAMERA) There you have it - unrehearsed testimonies from important celebrities. She's one of my favorites. I loved her in the thing I saw her in. You know, my course can help you with every personality disorder in the "Feel Bad" rainbow.
GOODMAN: Let's look at the rainbow. What's in there? (FAST) Depression, insomnia, motor-mouth, darting eyes, indecisiveness, decisiveness, bossiness, uncontrollable falling down, Geriatric Profanity Disorder or GPD, and chronic nagging. (ECHO EFFECT) Nagging, nagging, nagging...
Selma Bouvier: (RE: ECHO) Sorry, it does that sometimes.
(Simpson Living Room: Int. Simpsons' living room - day)
Homer Simpson: (À LA MARTIN) What up, Marge?
Marge Simpson: (HOLDING UP VIDEOTAPE BOX) I'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
Homer Simpson: Marge, can I go outside and play?
Marge Simpson: Shhh!
GOODMAN: Thank you so much, Troy. And by the way, I'm not happy you're still drinking. But at least you're down to one from more than fifty. Folks, I'm often asked about my qualifications. Well, I may not have a lot of (MAKES AIR QUOTES) "credentials" or (AIR QUOTES) "training." But I'll tell you one thing -- I'm a Ph.D. in Pain. Now let me show you how you can change your life.
GOODMAN: Troy, this circle is you.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson House - Living Room - sometime later)
Marge Simpson: That video really opened my eyes. I can see that I'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. By nagging you when you do foolish things, I just enable your life-script.
Homer Simpson: And that sends me into a shame spiral.
Marge Simpson: Exactly! So from now on, I'm going to quit nagging and have more fun.
Marge Simpson: Homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies?
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh. You're in for it now, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now.
Marge Simpson: I'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
Homer Simpson: And I feel that you hear my shame.
Marge Simpson: I'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance.
Homer Simpson: I feel validated by that.
Marge Simpson: Good. I'm glad we had this talk.
Homer Simpson: Me too.
Homer Simpson: Wow! For free, "SURPLUS DRUMS OF MAYONNAISE FROM OPERATION DESERT STORM."
Marge Simpson: (GASP) Brad Goodman is coming to town!
Homer Simpson: Oh Marge, you and I are fine now. Who needs Brad Goodman?
Bart Simpson: (WHOOPING IT UP)
(Parking Lot: Ext. parking lot - night)
Homer Simpson: Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture.
Lisa Simpson: (PUZZLED) We know, Dad.
Homer Simpson: I just thought I'd remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar.
Bart Simpson: What an odd thing to say.
(Auditorium: Int. auditorium)
GOODMAN: Thank you. Okay folks, let me hear what's troubling you. Don't be shy. Yell it out! Everybody, go!

C. Montgomery Burns: I'm too nice!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: I have problems with...
Lenny Leonard: (INTERRUPTING) I'm always interrupting people!
GOODMAN: Okay. Okay. Right now I want each of you to try something interesting. There's no trick to it; it's just a simple trick. Now Close your eyes for a moment and really listen to that inner voice inside, your Inner Child. Listen, what's he saying?
Flanders' Inner Child: Stay the course, Big Ned. You're doin' super!
Homer's Inner Child: (POINTS TO MOUTH) Food goes in here.
Homer Simpson: It sure does!
Moe's Inner Child: (ITALIAN ACCENT) Hey, Moe. What's a matta? You no talka with your accent no more.
Moe Szyslak: (SLAPPING HIS OWN CHEEK) Mamma mia!
GOODMAN: Principal Skinner, Let's try some rage work. I want you to pretend this dummy right here is your mother.
Seymour Skinner: (EMBARRASSED) Okay... I'll try.
GOODMAN: Tell this dummy mother exactly how you feel, right now.
Seymour Skinner: (BEAT) I'm annoyed with you, Mother. Not just annoyed... Angry! I'm a grown man now! And I can run MY OWN LIFE!!
GOODMAN: (GENTLY) Shh. Shh. Calm down. Calm down. Aw, moving. You can sit down now...
Seymour Skinner: We're still going antiquing on Saturday, right, mother?
GOODMAN: You see, folks? We're all trying to please someone else. And as soon as you're not a human BE-ING, you're a human DO-ING! Then what comes next?
Bart Simpson: A human GOING!
Marge Simpson: Bart! Be quiet!
GOODMAN: (AMUSED) Son, that's wonderful. Come here. Come up here.
GOODMAN: What made you yell out that remark?
Bart Simpson: I 'unno.
GOODMAN: You just wanted to express yourself. Yes?
Bart Simpson: (SHRUGS) I do what I feel like.
GOODMAN: That's marvelous! I-I couldn't have put it better myself. "I do what I feel like." People, this young man here IS the inner child I've been talking about.
Lisa Simpson: (SKEPTICAL) What!?
GOODMAN: Son, you've never read any of my books, have you?
Bart Simpson: (SNORTS) Earth to boring guy.
GOODMAN: (LAUGHING) That means no, eh? I'm not so old-fashioned. Your parents have done a fantastic job. (SCANS CROWD) Mama, Papa -- could you come up here?
Homer Simpson: (ACKNOWLEDGING APPLAUSE) Thank you. Very, very much.
GOODMAN: This is really remarkable. Here we have a man with an obvious eating disorder, and a woman with a bizarre hairstyle I'm sure worn only for shock value...
Marge Simpson: (OFFENDED NOISE)
GOODMAN: ... and yet they've managed to raise an emotionally healthy son. That's fantastic.
Marge Simpson: Oh, thank you.
GOODMAN: We can all learn a lot from this young man, here, this... this...
Bart Simpson: Rudiger.
GOODMAN: Rudiger. And if we can all be more like little Rudiger...
Marge Simpson: His name is Bart.
GOODMAN: (SNAPS AT HER) His name isn't important. What's important here is that this lad has fully developed ego integrity, with well-defined boundaries.
Bart Simpson: (MIMES SNORING)
GOODMAN: Ha ha. People, I am excited. I can sense a change in the air tonight. You are all gonna start living. Really living!
Crowd: YAAAYYY! (STARTING TO CHANT) LI-VING! LI-VING!

Lisa Simpson: This is madness. He's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
Carl Carlson: (HAPPILY) And how!
Kent Brockman: A new mood is in the air in Springfield, as refreshing as a pre-moistened towelette. Folks are finally accepting their feelings and really communicating, with no holding back. And this reporter thinks it's about fucking (BLEEP THE WORD) time. Of course, all these good vibes can be traced to one feisty little scamp who taught us that if it feels good, do it.
Kent Brockman: (ECSTATIC SLOBBERING AND EATING NOISES)
Bart Simpson: (REGALLY) Lis, today I am a god.

Bart Simpson: I'm blue. Time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass.
Bart Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh, man.
(Bart's Bedroom: Int. Bart's room - day)
Bart Simpson: (MOANING QUIETLY) Lis, everyone in town is acting like me, so why does it suck?
Lisa Simpson: It's simple, Bart. You've defined yourself as a rebel. And in the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted.
Bart Simpson: I see.
Lisa Simpson: Ever since that self-help guy came to town, you've lost your identity. You've fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-hour-photo, instant-oatmeal society.
Bart Simpson: What's the answer?
Lisa Simpson: Well, this is your chance to develop a new and better identity. May I suggest "good-natured doormat?"
Bart Simpson: Sounds good, sis. Just tell me what to do.
(NEWS SET: Int. news set)

Bart Simpson: Skateboards? You copycat wannabes.
Bart Simpson: Ow!
Seymour Skinner: Eat my shorts, young man.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Good afternoon, and welcome to the "Do What You Feel Festival." By the way, this young lady is not my wife, but I am sleeping with her. I'm telling you this because I'm comfortable with my womanizing.
Mayor Joe Quimby: And now, to usher in this new era of feeling good, is the uh godfather of soul, James Brown.
James Brown: (SINGING) I FEEL GOOD / I KNEW THAT I WOULD NOW / I FEEL GOOD / I KNEW THAT I WOULD / SO GOOD SO GOOD / I GOT YOU OW!
James Brown: Hey, wait a minute! Hold on, here. This bandstand wasn't double bolted.
Carpenter: (SHRUGGING) I didn't feel like it.
Homer Simpson: Hey, I hear ya, buddy.
Marge Simpson: (TO CARPENTER) Uh, I don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation, but my inner critic says you should've done your job!
Ned Flanders: Hey now, Marge. Let's not "should" this fella to death.
Groundskeeper Willie: Yeah, next you'll be laying a guilt trip on me for not oiling that ferris wheel.
Mayor Joe Quimby: In the spirit of the occasion, I must tell you what I think. You two screwed up royal.
Carpenter: Ya know, I really don't feel like being blamed.
Seymour Skinner: I feel that you should shut up!
Moe Szyslak: You know, you really irritate me, Skinner. What with your store-bought haircut and excellent posture.
Dorky Teenager: (SQUEAKY VOICE - TO MOE) Mister, I can't stand the sound of your voice.
Moe Szyslak: Oh really?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Oh now, now, there's no need to resort to violence.
Moe Szyslak: Ah, sure there is.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) I knew it. If only I had nagged more...
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: God is angry. We've made a false idol of this Brad Goodman.

(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - LIVING ROOM - THAT night)
Homer Simpson: Ah... boy, if only Bart had been a better role model for everyone.
Marge Simpson: That's not fair. The lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities.
Lisa Simpson: No! Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. It's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery.
Homer Simpson: That's what I've been saying. We're all fine the way we are.
Homer Simpson: Oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time.
Bart Simpson: Crank it, Homer.
Chief Wiggum: You busted up that crack house pretty bad, McGarnigal. Did you really have to break so much furniture?
MCGARNIGAL: You tell me, Chief. You had a pretty good view from behind your desk.
Homer Simpson: Ah, McGarnigal. Eases the pain.
Chief Wiggum: You're off the case, McGarnigal!
MCGARNIGAL: You're off your case, Chief.
Chief Wiggum: What does that mean, exactly?

Marge Simpson: I know you think the Junior Campers are square and... (AIR QUOTES) "uncool," but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies.
Homer Simpson: Marge, don't discourage the boy. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals. (BEAT) Except the weasel.
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. school - hallway - later)
Bart Simpson: (RE: BAG) All I've gotta do is take this uniform back after school.
Milhouse Van Houten: You're lucky, you only joined the Junior Campers. I got a dirty word shaved into the back of my head.
Seymour Skinner: (GASP) What is it with you kids and that word? (LEADING MILHOUSE AWAY) I'm going to shave you bald, young man, until you learn that hair is not a right, it's a privilege.

Bart Simpson: You guys get to play with knives?
Bart Simpson: Cool! A spork!
Pudgy Boy: (WHIMPERS FEARFULLY) Don't hurt me.
Ned Flanders: (TAKES KNIFE FROM BART) Oop, sorry, Bart, that's a Neddy no-no. You're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test.
Bart Simpson: Aw, who needs a cruddy knife anyway?
(Street: Ext. street - a little later)
Bart Simpson: Knives are boring.
Moe Szyslak: When I say put your beer on a coaster, I mean it.

Ned Flanders: Well, Homer, looks like we're boat buddies, huh? (HOLDS UP A FINGER OF GOOP) Want me to Zinc your sniffer?
(THE RIVER: Ext. the river - moments later)

Ned Flanders: Again? Homer, we have to ration the water carefully. It's our only hope.
Homer Simpson: (SMUG) Oh pardon me, Mr. Let's Ration Everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? Don't you know the poem? "Water, water everywhere/ So let's all have a drink."
Bart Simpson: Homer! No!
Homer Simpson: (COWED) Ohh... What does it matter? We're doomed!
Lenny Leonard: Run! We'll hide at my house!
Ned Flanders: Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die.
Homer Simpson: Woo-hoo! (VINDICATED) See that, boy? (PROUDLY) Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! (TURNING TO FLANDERS) In your face, Flanders!
Bart Simpson: (ANGRY) Well, at least Ned is trying! What are you doing to help?

Milhouse Van Houten: I fear to watch, yet I cannot turn away.
Seymour Skinner: (TO KRABAPPEL; BANGING HIS DOOR INTO HERS) Blasted woman, you parked too close. Move your car.

C. Montgomery Burns: That plane crashed on my property!
Agent #1: Look, Mr. Burns. We want to see some changes. For starters, you can reverse your sexist employment policies and hire at least one woman.

Marge Simpson: (GASP) Lisa's costume. (SIGH) Homer, I didn't realize. I'm so sorry.

Homer Simpson: Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears?
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: Well, that's nothing, because you have a gambling problem! And remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like Santa Claus?
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: Well, you have a gambling problem!
Marge Simpson: Homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them like that.

Marge Simpson: And my necklace.
Homer Simpson: Eh, that's no big loss.
Marge Simpson: Homer! That necklace was a priceless Bouvier family heirloom.

Marge Simpson: (LAUGHS UPROARIOUSLY)
Nelson Muntz: (OVER PHONE) Stamp collection. Haw haw!
Lisa Simpson: (MOANS) Bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't. That saxophone was my one creative outlet. It was the only way I could truly express myself.

Lou: Hey look, Chief. It's pointing right at this police station.
Chief Wiggum: (PANICKED) Let's get outta here!
Kent Brockman: When cat burglaries start, can mass murders be far behind? This reporter isn't saying that the burglar is an inhuman monster like the Wolfman, but he very well could be.
Kent Brockman: So, professor, would you say it's time for everyone to panic?
Professor: Yes I would, Kent.
Chief Wiggum: Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen please, we have a major break in the case. We recovered the burglar's handkerchief from one of the crime scenes. Now one sniff of this baby and our tracking dog will be hot on his trail. (THEN ASIDE) Gosh, look at me, I'm sweating like a pig here...

IRISH PETE: And a fine job ye did too!

Homer Simpson: Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that.
Kent Brockman: I see. Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?
Homer Simpson: Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes. (LONG PAUSE)

Homer Simpson: Why you monster! And you have my daughter's saxophone too!
Kent Brockman: Homer, that's our stage manager!
Homer Simpson: (EMBARRASSED) Oh sorry. I'm a little nervous.
Cat Burglar: It may interest you to know that for my next crime I'll be pinching the pride and joy of the Springfield Museum, the world's largest cubic zirconia.
Homer Simpson: Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the Springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on (CONSIDERING) unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time.
Homer Simpson: (À LA MERV) We'll be right back.

(Springfield Museum: Ext. Springfield museum - night)
Grampa Simpson: Son, we wanna help you catch that plug-ugly-yegg.

Lisa Simpson: (EXCITED, AD LIBBING) What? Who? Huh? What?
Grampa Simpson: (GLOATING) Well, well, well. Before I was too old and no one wanted my help. Suddenly, look who comes to old Grampa for--wait! Where're you going?

(Museum: ext. museum)
Grampa Simpson: Molloy said, 'I'll catch up with you.'
Grampa Simpson: I couldn't quite put my finger on it. There was something strange about the way he walked. Much more vertical than usual. And finally, Molloy, unlike most retired people, has the world's largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table.
Homer Simpson: Aw, Dad, I could kiss you.
Grampa Simpson: Well kiss me right here. It's the only part that still has feeling.

Seymour Skinner: How ironic.
Molloy: Homer old chum. Well done. If anyone was going to catch me, I'm glad it was you.
Homer Simpson: Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa.
Grampa Simpson: Thanks, son. So you see old people aren't so useless after all. Molloy's old and he outsmarted the lot of ya. And I'm even older and I outsmarted him. (LAUGHS)
Moe Szyslak: Shut up.
Grampa Simpson: I've had my moment.
Molloy: And of course, I'm happy to return all of your treasured possessions.
Molloy: (HANDING IT TO HER) Selma, my dear, your lock of MacGyver's hair.

Molloy: And little Lisa, here's your saxophone.

Molloy: It's buried right here in Springfield, under a Big T.
Homer Simpson: (VERY CASUAL) No kidding.

Homer Simpson: (SUDDENLY CALM) Oh.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (DROPPING POSE) You know, now that I think about it, it may be a little confusing. Many have died needlessly. I have come to make amends.

Homer Simpson: (CONFUSED) You're selling what now?

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Yes, yes you are right, sir. I've got to accept my fate. I have feared it for long enough now. (DRAMATICALLY) I'm going to go down to the Kwik-E-Mart and I'm going to face my demon.

Stacy Lovell: Not since I was forced out in nineteen seventy-four. They said my way of thinking just wasn't cost effective.
Lisa Simpson: That's awful!
Stacy Lovell: Well, that, and I was funneling profits to the Vietcong.
Lisa Simpson: But you are Malibu Stacy, and as long as she has your name, you have a responsibility. I'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the Simpson name on it.
Stacy Lovell: I may have had things in common with Stacy in the beginning, but thirty years of living her lifestyle taught me some very harsh lessons. Five husbands...
Stacy Lovell: Ken, Johnny, Joe, Dr. Colossus, Steve Austin...

Stacy Lovell: Hmm, not enough commercial appeal.
Bart Simpson: "Wendy Windbag"? "Ugly Doris"? "Hortense: The Mule-faced Doll"?

Kent Brockman: (CHUCKLE) Please, honey, Daddy's job is to bring people important news. Right now I'm very busy preparing a report about the fortieth anniversary of Beetle Bailey.
Brockman's Daughter: Oh, Daddy, that is boring! Talk about the dolly!
Kent Brockman: (THINKS) Well... You were right about the Berlin Wall.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - the next night)
Kent Brockman: Though it was unusual to spend twenty-eight minutes reporting on a doll, this reporter found it impossible to stop talking. It's just really fascinating news, folks. Goodnight.
Kent Brockman: Oh, and the President was arrested for murder. More on that tomorrow night... or you can turn to another channel.
Kent Brockman: Oh. (STIFFLY) Do not turn to another channel.

Old Lady Customer: These eggs are difficult to digest. I want soft-boiled eggs.
Grampa Simpson: I told you we don't have soft boiled eggs. If you -- (THINKING) ...By gum you're right, we should have 'em. I shouldn't be listening to complaints, I should be makin' 'em with you guys. The good Lord lets us grow old for a reason: to gain the wisdom to find fault with everything he's made!
Grampa Simpson: Mr. Peterson, you can take this job and... fill it. And one more thing. I never once washed my hands - that's your policy, not mine.

Waylon Smithers: (POINTING) But she's got a new hat.
Girls: (BEAT, THEN) I wannit! I wannit! etc.
Lisa Simpson: Well, I guess you can't beat big business. There's just no room for the little guy.
Doll: (LISA'S VOICE) Trust in yourself and you can achieve anything.
Lisa Simpson: (TOUCHED) You know, if we get through to just that one little girl, it'll all be worth it.
Stacy Lovell: (LOW) Yes. Particularly if that little girl happens to pay $46,000 for that doll.
Lisa Simpson: What?
Stacy Lovell: Oh, nothing. Kudos to you, Lisa! Kudos!

Homer Simpson: Hey.
Carl Carlson: I hate these Worker of the Week award ceremonies.
Lenny Leonard: Who even cares anymore? Everyone that works here has already got one.
Carl Carlson: Except forrrrr...
Homer Simpson: Hello. Well, today's the day for Homer J. I know I'm gonna win this time.
Lenny Leonard: Yeah, how come?
Homer Simpson: (VERY COCKY) Union rule twenty-six - (READING) "Every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor." (CHUCKLE)
Waylon Smithers: Attention, everyone. Let's have an awed hush please for Mr. Burns.
Race: They'll clog the instruments!
C. Montgomery Burns: Compadres, it is imperative that we crush the freedom fighters before the start of the rainy season. And remember, a shiny new donkey for whoever brings me the head of Colonel Montoya.
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh? What? (COVERING TO CROWD) And by that I mean, of course, it's time for the Worker of the Week Award. I can't believe we've overlooked this week's winner for so very very long. We simply could not function without his tireless efforts. So, a round of applause for... this inanimate carbon rod.
Crowd Noise: (ADLIBBING)
Homer Simpson: Inanimate huh? I'll show him inanimate! (FURIOUS GROWLS)
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpsons HOUSE - NIGHT)
Homer Simpson: Stupid carbon rod. It's all just a popularity contest.

Nasa Announcer #1: (À LA BROKAW) It's a lovely day for a launch here live at Cape Canaveral at the lower end of the Florida peninsula. And the purpose of today's mission is truly, really electrifying.
Nasa Announcer #2: (LIFELESS) That's correct, Tom. The lion share of this flight will be devoted to the study of the effects of weightlessness on tiny screws.
Nasa Announcer #1: Unbelievable! And just imagine the logistics of weightlessness. And of course this could have literally millions of applications here on Earth... in everything from watch making to watch repair.
Homer Simpson: Boring.
Homer Simpson: (PANICKED) No, the batteries!
Nasa Announcer #1: Now let's look at the crew a little.
Nasa Announcer #2: They're a colorful bunch; they've been dubbed the "Three Musketeers." (CHUCKLES)
Nasa Announcer #1: And we laugh legitimately. There's a mathematician, a different kind of mathematician and a statistician.
Homer Simpson: Make it stop!
Bart Simpson: Oh no, not another boring space launch! Change the channel! Change the channel!
Homer Simpson: I can't! I can't!

STILLWATER: Oh my God! We've been beaten by "A Connie Chung Christmas."
(Nasa: Int. NASA - conference room)
STILLWATER: People, we're in danger of losing our funding. America isn't interested in space exploration anymore.
Dr. Babcock: Maybe we should finally tell them the big secret, that all the chimps we sent into space came back super intelligent.
Chimp: (ARROGANT; ENGLISH ACCENT) No, I don't think we'll be telling them that.
STILLWATER: We need a fresh angle to get the public interested.
Dr. Babcock: The public see our astronauts as clean-cut, athletic go-getters. They hate people like that.
Female Scientist: Well who do they like?
Dr. Babcock: Well, here are the most popular personalities on televison or (AIR QUOTES) TV.
TIM ALLEN-TYPE: I did it! I supercharged my riding mower. (TRADEMARK MACHO SHOUT)
TIM ALLEN-TYPE: Oh no! I've killed Wilson. Looks like it's back to jail for me. (TRADEMARK MACHO SOUND)
Peg: Al, let's have sex.
Al: Uh, no Peg.
Nerdy Scientist: Why, they're all a bunch of blue collar slobs.
STILLWATER: People, that's who we need for our next astronaut.
Dr. Babcock: I suggest a lengthy, inefficient search, at the tax payers expense, of course.
STILLWATER: God, I wish there was an easier way.
Homer Simpson: Hello, is this NASA?
STILLWATER: Yes.
Homer Simpson: Good. (ANGRILY) Listen, I'm sick of your boring space launches. Now I'm just an ordinary blue collar slob, but I know what I likes on TV...
STILLWATER: How did you get this number?
Homer Simpson: Shut up. And another thing - how come I can't get no Tang 'round here? And also... hold on a second.
STILLWATER: People, our long search is over.
(Moe's Tavern: Ext. Moe's bar - night)
Homer Simpson: Hello, is this President Clinton? Good. I figured if anyone knew where to get some Tang it'd be you... shut up!
Dr. Babcock: Are you the person that called NASA yesterday?
Homer Simpson: (GASP) No. It wasn't me, I swear. It was... him.
STILLWATER: Sir, how would you like to get higher than you've ever been in your life?
Barney Gumble: Be an astronaut? Sure.
STILLWATER: Well, welcome aboard. I think you'll find that this will win you the respect of your family and friends.
Homer Simpson: (GASP) Respect?! Nooo! It was me! I made the crank call. I do it all the time. Check with the FBI, I have a file. I HAVE A FIIIIILE.
STILLWATER: (SHRUGGING) Eh, better take both of them.
STILLWATER: I don't really think that was necessary. They wanted to be astronauts.
Dr. Babcock: I know.

Jim Wallace: Jim Wallace, Associated Press. (BEAT) Is this a joke?
STILLWATER: Far from it, Jim. One of these men will prove space travel is within the reach of the common man.
Toby Hunter: Toby Hunter, Minneapolis Star. No, really. Is this a joke?
STILLWATER: (ANNOYED) No Toby. And no more questions about whether this is a joke.
Reporter #1: Uh... question for the barbecue chef: don't you think there is an inherent danger in sending under-qualified civilians into space?
Homer Simpson: I'll field this one. The only danger is if they send us to that terrible Planet of the Apes. (THINKS) ...Wait a minute, Statue of Liberty... That was our planet. (WAILING) You maniacs! You blew it up! Damn you! Damn you all to hell.
STILLWATER: Thank you, I'm afraid that's all we have time for.
(Nasa: ext. NASA - day)
STILLWATER: Now of course only one of you will be chosen to go into space, so the next few weeks will be a grueling series of tests to determine which one of you is most qualified.
Dr. Babcock: Oh, and Mr. Gumbel - for the duration of the training, there'll be no more beer.
Barney Gumble: What? Three whole weeks with only wine? I'll go crazy?
BUZZ: (DODGING CHIPS) Careful, they're ruffled!
Homer Simpson: I'll take care of this.
Homer Simpson: And may the best man win. (TO BABCOCK) He's got a big drinking problem - could embarrass the program. Meet me up in that tree later and I'll tell you more.
(SIMPSONS' BASE KITCHEN: int. Simpsons' BASE kitchen - evening)

Marge Simpson: Pride?
Bart Simpson: No, not that far from shame.
Homer Simpson: (HOPEFUL) Less shame?
Bart Simpson: (AFFECTIONATELY) Yeah.
Marge Simpson: You know, Homer, when I found out about this I went through a wide range of emotions. First I was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. But now I realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do.
Homer Simpson: (NOT LISTENING) Who's doin' what now?
(NASA Training Facility: Int. NASA Training facility)
Homer Simpson: Well here I am, right on time. I don't see Barney "Let's-crash-the-rocket-into-the-White-House-and-kill-the-President" Gumbel.

Barney Gumble: Hi Homer, since they made me stop drinking, I've regained my balance and diction. Observe.
Barney Gumble: (AS HE FLIPS) I AM THE VERY MODEL OF A MODERN MAJOR GENERAL / I'VE INFORMATION VEGETABLE, ANIMAL, AND MINERAL.
Homer Simpson: (TO DR. BABCOCK, DESPERATELY) Aw, that's nothin'. Watch this. (AS HE BEGINS RUNNING) There once was a man from Nantucket (UNSTEADY NOISE)
Homer Simpson: (À LA POPEYE) I can't stands no more.
Homer Simpson: Mmmmm. Mediciney.
Dr. Babcock: I wager 400 quatloos on the newcomer.
(Locker Room: Int. locker room - day)
STILLWATER: Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet the two experienced astronauts who will accompany the winner into space. Race Banyon and Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon.
BUZZ: (PROUDLY) Second comes right after first.
BUZZ: So Barney, we hear you're kickin' ass.
Homer Simpson: Ahem... I uh... don't think this contest is over yet, Buzz. If that is your real name. I believe there Is still a little something called the swimsuit competition.
STILLWATER: There's no swimsuit competition, Homer.
Homer Simpson: You mean I shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
STILLWATER: Gentlemen, you've both worked very hard, and in a way you're both winners. But in another more accurate way, Barney is the winner.
Homer Simpson: (HEARTFELT) Congratulations, Barney.
STILLWATER: That's very gracious of you, Homer. Please join us in a toast.
Dr. Babcock: To the mission.
Barney Gumble: (QUIET OMINOUSLY) It begins.

Marge Simpson: (MILDLY ANNOYED) Homer, you already dialed.
Homer Simpson: Oh. (WHINY)

And then when I got there, they told me he just left. And when I asked the mall guy if he would ever come back again, (SAD) he said he didn't know. Well, I'm never gonna let something like that happen again. I'm going into space, right now.

Homer Simpson: Wow! Former president James Taylor.
James Taylor: How ya doin', fellas?
BUZZ: With all due respect, Mr. Taylor, this isn't the best time for your unique brand of bittersweet folk rock. We have a potentially critical situation here. I'm sure you'll understand.
James Taylor: Listen, Aldrin, I'm not as laid back as people think. Now here's the deal: I'm gonna play and you're gonna float there and like it.

Kent Brockman: (CALMLY) Ladies and gentlemen, we've just lost the picture, but uh, what we've seen speaks for itself. The Corvair spacecraft has apparently been taken over, conquered, if you will, by a master race of giant space ants. It's difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive Earthmen or merely enslave them. One thing is for certain, there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here. And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords. I'd like to remind them that as a trusted TV personality, I can be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves.

Homer Simpson: (COWARDLY) It was him!
Stan: Ned? Is that...? Ned Flanders?
Ned Flanders: Hidilly ho, Stanster.
Homer Simpson: You know Stan Taylor?
Stan: Know me? Ned Flanders saved me. I used to party all night and sleep with lingerie models, until Ned and his Bible group showed me that I could have more.
Homer Simpson: (SOTTO, DISGUSTED) Professional athletes. Always wantin' more.
Stan: (HANDING HIM BALL) Ned, they gave me the game ball. I want you to have it.
Ned Flanders: Stan, tell you what -- Homer Simpson here is just about the biggest Atom fan that's ever graced God's green earth. I bet he'd enjoy it, even more than me.
Stan: Sure. (HANDS HOMER THE BALL) Anything for Neddie. Here you go.
Homer Simpson: Wow, thanks. Now I have four children. (TO BALL) You will be called "Stitch-face." Wow, Flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
(Parking Lot: Ext. parking lot - after game)
Ned Flanders: Ooo, I guess it's time for me to duck again.
Homer Simpson: (STOPPING HIM) No! I want everyone to know that (STICKS HIS HEAD OUT WINDOW) this is Ned Flanders... my friend!

Homer Simpson: I'll be there. And this time you can be the nacho man.
Lisa Simpson: Dad and Ned Flanders friends? What's next... "A's" on Bart's report card?
Bart Simpson: (REALIZING) Hey.
(FLANDERS' REC ROOM: Int. Flanders' rec room)
Ned Flanders: Uh, be careful there, Homer. That is sort of a new table. (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)
Homer Simpson: Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese.
Homer Simpson: Now you got a law suit on your hands. Just kidding.
Father: What's wrong, Jeremiah?
Jeremiah: It's not fair. My brother Joseph has a sin to confess. I wish I had one too.
Father: Oh don't you see? You do have a sin to confess - the sin of envy.
Todd Flanders: That's all well and good for sheep, but what are we to do?
Homer Simpson: Boring. Let's watch something else.
Todd Flanders: (DISAPPOINTED) Aw.
Ned Flanders: Now, boys, Mr. Simpson is the guest. He gets to decide what to watch.
Homer Simpson: Yeah.
Homer Simpson: Hey what gives? I thought you had a satellite dish.
Ned Flanders: Sure didilly do. Over two hundred and thirty channels locked out.
Maude Flanders: Okay, boys, time for bed. Say good night.
Todd Flanders: Good night, Daddy. Good night, Uncle Homer.
Homer Simpson: (A LITTLE TOUCHED) Aw, Uncle Homer. Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, I want you to get to know my family. (PUTS ARM AROUND NED)

Ned Flanders: (PRAYING) ...Bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house.
Homer Simpson: Hiya, Flanders! Oooh... dinner! May I join you?
Ned Flanders: (NOT MEANING IT) Homer, I-I'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night I do my charity work.
Homer Simpson: Oh, yeah. A judge made me do that once, too. Stupid lack of public urinals. Hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, I'm comin' with ya.
Ned Flanders: (FADING SMILE) Oh... well... that sounds super duper.
(SHELTER: Ext. shelter - ESTABLISHING)
Priest: Oh, you poor, unfortunate man. Let's get you out of those clothes immediately. And we'll do whatever we can about the smell.
Homer Simpson: But... (CHEERFULLY) all right.
Homer Simpson: (IMPATIENTLY CHECKS WATCH) C'mon! We've been here for fifteen minutes. Can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?
Ned Flanders: Homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at Moe's tonight.
Homer Simpson: Ah, for some reason, Moe's is always closed on Wednesdays.
Moe Szyslak: (READING TO MEN) ...And then they realized they were no longer little girls, they were little women. (SNIFFLE)
Homer Simpson: (VERY IMPATIENT) Come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. Oh, I can do it faster that that.
Reporter: Wow! Look at that enthusiasm! This is front page material!
(Simpson Living Room: INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - DAY)
Marge Simpson: Homey, I'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with Ned? Your family needs you too.
Homer Simpson: Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe.
Marge Simpson: That was you!
Homer Simpson: Love, Marge. Don't hate. Love.
Bart Simpson: The Flanders are a buncha geeks, man.
Ned Flanders: (WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY) Sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly...
Homer Simpson: The Flanderses are not geeks! (THEN QUICKLY) Okay, Rod and Todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. But we've got to give this thing a chance. I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend.
Bart Simpson: No way, José !
Homer Simpson: Yes way.
Lisa Simpson: Don't worry, Bart. It seems like every week something odd happens to the Simpsons. My advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure.
Bart Simpson: Ay caramba!
Lisa Simpson: That's the spirit.
(Highway: Ext. highway - day)

(Campsite: Ext. campsite - later)
Marge Simpson: There. I hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch.
Lisa Simpson: We got the recipe from the Fruit Punch Advisory Board.
Maude Flanders: Oh gosh, I'm sorry, our boys don't eat sugar.
Marge Simpson: But, why would the Advisory Board give us bad advice?
Maude Flanders: (FIRMLY) No sugar!
Lisa Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMURS)
Rod Flanders: Thank you, but we're not allowed.
Bart Simpson: Aw it's okay, there's no sugar in pixie sticks. Trust me.

Todd Flanders: Go to hell, zit face!
Bart Simpson: (EVIL CHUCKLE)
Todd Flanders: Lies made baby Jesus cry.
Homer Simpson: I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders. If this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the Flimpsons.
Homer Simpson: So, here's to my best friend, Ned.
Ned Flanders: (RAISING GLASS) Eh, well sir. My entire family is very touched and--
Homer Simpson: Food fight!
Bart Simpson: Yeah!
(Parking Lot: Ext. parking lot - later)
Homer Simpson: Whatcha doin'?
Ned Flanders: We're headin' back. Todd's got Zesty Italian in his eye.
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Okay. But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin!
Ned Flanders: Oh, I don't know...
Homer Simpson: Too late.
Ned Flanders: Oh Lord, please give me the strength to endure Homer Simpson's friendship.

Ned Flanders: We did it, we got rid of...
(Roadside: Ext. roadside - moments later)
Ned Flanders: I told you, officer. I'm not "hepped up" on "goof balls."
Chief Wiggum: Yeah right.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ned Flanders, I never would have imagined.
Chief Wiggum: (WAVING AND POINTING) High as a kite, everybody! Goofballs--
Chief Wiggum: (À LA EDWARD G. ROBINSON) Where's your messiah now, Flanders?
(FIRST CHURCH: Ext. First church - later)
Ned Flanders: I can't do it, Maude. I can't face their accusing eyes.
Maude Flanders: Oh don't worry, Ned, this is a house of love and forgiveness.
Voice #1: (GASPS) There he is, Ned Flanders.
Voice #2: The fallen one.
Voice #3: The evil one.
Voice #4: I'll bet he's the one who wrote "Homer" all over the bathroom.
Ned Flanders: I think we should leave.
Homer Simpson: (WHISTLING THROUGH HIS FINGERS) Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-ass seats.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Before I get started on today's sermon entitled (POINTEDLY AT NED), "What Ned Did," I'd like to publicly congratulate Homer Simpson on his recent charity work.
Homer Simpson: I live to give.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: That's beautiful. We appreciate the kisses. Now, let us bow our heads in a silent prayer of thanksgiving.
Ned Flanders: (EXPLODING AT HOMER) Stop it! Breathe through your damn mouth!
Ned Flanders: Oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! (SHOUTING) He's annoying. He's very, very annoying!
Helen Lovejoy: Well Ned Flanders is just jealous!
Moe Szyslak: Aw, the guy's hepped up on "goof balls!"
Grampa Simpson: Let's sacrifice him to our god! (OFF THEIR LOOKS) C'mon, we did it all the time in the thirties.
Congregation: (ADLIBBING)
Homer Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! (TO THE CHURCH) How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He's a wonderful, kind, caring man. Maybe even more so than me. There have been times when I've lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. But this man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for heaven. We'd already be there.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (EMBARRASSED) Um... Well I think we all owe Ned a heartfelt apology. We were wrong to doubt him.
Lenny Leonard: (RE: LOVEJOY) Hey, that guy's right!
Congregation: (ADLIBBING)
Marge Simpson: That was a very nice thing you did, Homey.
Ned Flanders: Thank you. Thank you so much, Homer. You really are a (SNIFFLES) you're a true friend.
Homer Simpson: Right back atcha, buddy.
Homer Simpson: Now how 'bout that game at the Pitch 'n Putt?
Ned Flanders: Just try and stop me.
Bart Simpson: I don't get it, Lis. You said everything would be back to normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah. Maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Homer Simpson: Guess what, everyone?! My great uncle Boris died and left us his old country house. There's only one catch they say - it's haunted. But I'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there.
Ned Flanders: Hi-diddly ho, neighbor.
Homer Simpson: Get lost, Flanders.
Ned Flanders: Okilly-dokilly.

Lisa Simpson: And I'm going to the park to jam with the Little White Girls Blues Quartet. Wanna come with me, Daddy-o?
Bill Clinton: Make me.
C. Montgomery Burns: Eeeeeee!!
Homer Simpson: I'd love to honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today.
Bart Simpson: Think you'll win?
Homer Simpson: Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. It's how drunk you get.
Bart Simpson: Gotcha. Well, gotta go.
Lisa Simpson: Me too.
Bart Simpson: Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom.
Homer Simpson: (HELPFULLY) Push her down, son.
Marge Simpson: No one's going anywhere. We're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom.
Lisa Simpson: (GASP)
Homer Simpson: Oh dear God, no.
Marge Simpson: I think you'll find that escape is impossible. Now each one of you take a floor and get started.

Ernie Ford: (SINGING) YOU LOAD SIXTEEN TONS/ WHADDAYA GET/ ANOTHER DAY OLDER AND DEEPER IN DEBT...
Bart Simpson: Amen, Ernie.
Homer Simpson: (DUSTS HANDS) All done.
Marge Simpson: You're not done. I want you to throw away these old calendars and TV Guides.
Homer Simpson: Are you mad, woman? You never know when an old calendar might come in handy. Sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? And these TV Guides... so many memories.
Homer Simpson: (READING) "Gomer upsets Sergeant Carter." Ooooh, I'll never forget that episode!
Carter: Pyle!
Gomer: Shazam!
Carter: Pyle!
Gomer: Shazam!
Carter: Pyle!
Gomer: Shazam!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Shazam.
Marge Simpson: (SHARPLY) Stop remembering TV and get back to work.
Homer Simpson: (AFTER HER) What's the point of all this cleaning? (MELODRAMATIC) Are we so vain?
Moe Szyslak: Hey Clinton, get back to work!
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) They're having a great time and I'm stuck in here.

Homer Simpson: (NORMAL) Nothing.
Marge Simpson: Then stop screaming so loud.
Homer Simpson: (NORMAL) Okay.
Homer Simpson: (QUIET SCREAMING)
Bill: And that was "Take this job and shove it." Now let's make another one of our lucky phone calls.
Marty: Okay, just answer the phone with THE SPECIAL PHRASE THAT PAYS and you'll have your choice of ten thousand dollars in cash.
Marty: (CHUCKLES) Or a really stupid prize.
Bill: Well, let's make that call.
Bart Simpson: (YELLING) KBBL is gonna give me something stupid!
Grampa Simpson: Bart, I'm having palpitations.
Bart Simpson: (QUICKLY) Can't tie up the line, Grampa.
Marge Simpson: (SATISFIED) There! Isn't that a lot better? Now you can do whatever you want. But don't mess up the house.
Lisa Simpson: (MOROSE) We won't.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)

Snake Jailbird: Fry, Piggy.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. Simpsons' kitchen)
Chief Wiggum: No! No! No, don't! (GETTING TASERED NOISE, THEN) A little to the left... Ah. That's the stuff.
Marty: Oh, I'm sorry. The phrase is "KBBL is gonna give me something stupid."
Goofy Recording: Pret-ty wee-ird! (WACKY BOING AND LAUGH)
Bill: Let's try one more number.
Bart Simpson: (GASPS)
Homer Simpson: Y'ello.
Bart Simpson: (YELLING) KBBL is gonna give me something stupid!
Bill: Well, hot dog! We have a "wiener"!
Homer Simpson: (INTO EMPTY HAND) Y'ello?
Bart Simpson: I won! I won!
Bart Simpson: (YELLING) Where's my elephant?!
Marty: You win your choice of ten thousand dollars or - what's our gag prize this week, Bill? - (LAUGHS) a full grown African elephant!
Bart Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty. But I think I'm gonna have to go with the elephant.
Homer Simpson: (KNOWINGLY) He's taking the elephant instead of the money.
Bill: (SOTTO) The kid wants the elephant.
Marty: (SOTTO) We don't have a damn elephant!
Bill: (SOTTO) Don't whisper into the Mic.
Marty: (SMALL COUGH) Kid, the elephant's a gag prize. Nobody takes the gag prize. (LEADING) You want the cash.
Bart Simpson: (FIRM) I want the elephant.
Homer Simpson: Heh, heh. Stick it to the man. (FINALLY DAWNING) No, wait!
Homer Simpson: We'll call you back! (HANGS UP) Bart! With ten thousand dollars we'd be millionaires. We could buy all kinds of useful things, like... (THINKS) ... love.
Marge Simpson: Or double-ply windows! They look just like regular windows but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill...
Marge Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) Well, they will.
Lisa Simpson: You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing. Which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, go to your room.
(KBBL Studios: Ext. KBBL establishing)
(Radio Station: Int. radio station)
Bill: We appreciate you coming down but, look kid, the thing is, uh (WEAK LAUGH) we don't have an elephant.
Marty: Come on, kid, just take the money, huh? Otherwise we might get fired. You don't want us to get fired, do you?
Bart Simpson: Eh, either way.
Marty: (GASP)
Bill: We think we know how your mind works, Bart. So how 'bout this; we pay your principal ten thousand dollars to pull down his pants and keep 'em down for the rest of the school year. (LAUGH)
Seymour Skinner: I'll do it, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Umm... No.
Marty: Okay, okay. What if we use the ten thousand to surgically transform Skinner here into some kind of a lobster-like creature?
Seymour Skinner: Now wait just a minute. That wasn't discussed with me.
Bart Simpson: Uh, gentlemen, I am not leaving without my elephant.
Bart Simpson: Hey!
Homer Simpson: Wee!
Bart Simpson: Where's my elephant!
Bart Simpson: Where's my elephant!
(Springfield Retirement Castle: Int. old folks home)
Bart Simpson: (FAINT) Where's my elephant?!
Grampa Simpson: Hey, they're playing the elephant song.

Station Owner: Look, our ratings are down, and the station is being swamped with angry calls and letter bombs.
Station Owner: And it's all your fault.
Marty: Yes it is, Ma'am.
Station Owner: This is the DJ3000. It plays CDs automatically, and it has three distinct varieties of inane chatter.
Dj3000: Hey, hey, how about that weather out there?... Whoa, that was the caller from hell... Well hot dog! We have a wiener...
Marty: (IMPRESSED) Man, that thing's great.
Bill: (NUDGING Marty) Don't - praise - the - machine.
Station Owner: If you don't get that kid an elephant by tomorrow, the DJ3000 gets your job.

Marty: (CHUCKLES, THEN SHAKES HEAD ADMIRINGLY) How's he keep up with the news like that?
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house)
Marge Simpson: (SMALL SCREAM)
Bart Simpson: (IN AWE) Whoa!

Homer Simpson: Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore.
Bart Simpson: He smells worse than anything! Hey, you! Elephant! Lift me up on your back, man.
Marge Simpson: Bart!!!
Bart Simpson: Cool! He tried to kill me!
Marge Simpson: I really think this is a bad idea.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory Communism works. In theory.
Bart Simpson: Look, he thinks he's people.
(Simpson Backyard: ext. Simpson back yard)
Bart Simpson: I think I'm gonna call him Stampy.
Homer Simpson: What's he yelling about?
(Simpson Living Room: int. Simpson living room)
Lisa Simpson: He's hungry. Here you go, Stampy. Eat it slow. It has to last for...
Lisa Simpson: (QUIETLY) You ate it too fast.
Homer Simpson: Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry.
Lisa Simpson: You can't do that, Dad. It's cruel.
Homer Simpson: Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So excuse me if I'm cruel.
Homer Simpson: Now I've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth.
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's)
Moe Szyslak: I think you're taking unfair advantage of my generous offer.

Homer Simpson: (THOUGHTFULLY) Plants, eh?
(ARBORETUM: Ext. arboretum)
Bart Simpson: (HELPFULLY) Strip the bark now, Stampy.
Homer Simpson: Hey, any more arboretums around here?
Arboretum Guy: (BITTERLY) No.
Homer Simpson: (GASP) That bird! He's killing the elephant! Stop him!
Lisa Simpson: No, Dad. He's grooming him.
Homer Simpson: (INTERESTED) Grooming him, eh?
(Simpson Living Room: Int. Simpson LIVING ROOM)

(Simpson Kitchen: int. Simpson kitchen)
Lisa Simpson: Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Nah. He doesn't want to learn and I don't want to teach him. We get along fine.
Homer Simpson: Hey, what's with them?
Lisa Simpson: I think they're trying to get some attention.
Homer Simpson: Oh. (SCORN) Good luck. Look at these bills. (READING) "Chain for elephant," "Shots for elephant"... "Oversized decorative poncho".
Bart Simpson: Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little.
Homer Simpson: Well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.
Bart Simpson: You'll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week.
Homer Simpson: Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson home)
Small Kid: Can we see the elephant?
MEDIUM-SIZED KID: We'll pay you money.
Homer Simpson: For the ninth time, no!
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, this gives me an idea.
Bart Simpson: Uh, here's a better sign, Dad.
Homer Simpson: I don't have time to read. Just give me the gist of it, son.
(Simpson Backyard: Ext. Simpson backyard - next day)
Homer Simpson: Your kid flew five feet. That counts as a ride. Two bucks.
Kid's Mother: (DOUBTFUL) Well, that was never five feet.
Helen Lovejoy: That animal of yours is certainly bad-tempered.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels.
Cletus Spuckler: Hey, Maw. Look at that pointy-haired little girl. (HICK LAUGH)
Lisa Simpson: (MURMUR)
Bart Simpson: You guys don't understand Stampy. He's just like me. We're a pair of jokers and both of us are wild. We don't take nothin' from nobody.
C. Montgomery Burns: (HAPPILY) Smithers, this reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house)
Homer Simpson: Look at this, Marge! Fifty-eight dollars! And all of it profit! I'm the smartest businessman in the world!
Marge Simpson: Stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars.
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) Marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money.
(Simpson Backyard: EXT. SIMPSON BACKYARD)
(Van Houten Home: Int. Milhouse's house)
Homer Simpson: Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once. Right?
Luann Van Houten: Yes. But we paid you four dollars.
Homer Simpson: Well, that was under our old price structure. Under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. Now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me.
Kirk Van Houten: Get off our property.
Homer Simpson: This town is full of deadbeats. We can't afford this elephant.
Bart Simpson: No, Dad, he's my friend!
Homer Simpson: Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him.
(Simpson Backyard: Ext. Simpson backyard)
Grizzled Guy: Well sir, I'll be honest with you. I need a large African elephant. And I need it today. But I'm afraid this just isn't what I'm lookin' for.
Homer Simpson: What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it?
Grizzled Guy: Well it is and it isn't, if you understand what I mean.
Homer Simpson: (LONG BEAT) He likes peanuts.
(Simpson Living Room: int. Simpson living room)
Wildlife Man: Our wildlife refuge is the ideal environment for your elephant. Thousands of acres of simulated African Savannah.
Lisa Simpson: It's perfect, Dad.
Homer Simpson: I only have two questions. How much, and give it to me.
Wildlife Man: Well we really can't offer you any money. We're a non-profit organization.
Homer Simpson: So, your bid is zero.
Wildlife Man: Well, we like to think of it as --
Homer Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Thank you.
Wildlife Man: You know I really think --
Homer Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Thank you.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house)
Ivory Dealer: Simpson, I think you'll find this amount more than fair.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer. His boots are ivory, his hat is ivory, and I'm pretty sure that check is ivory.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.
Santa's Little Helper: (A THROATY GROWL THAT SOUNDS LIKE "WE LOVE"...)
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Blackheart?
Ivory Dealer: Yes, my pretty?
Lisa Simpson: Are you an ivory dealer?
Ivory Dealer: (CHUCKLES) Little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day. Whale hunter, seal clubber, President of the Fox Network. And like most people, yeah I've dealt a little ivory.
Bart Simpson: Dad, you can't do this. Stampy is my friend.
Homer Simpson: (SYMPATHETICALLY) Don't worry, son. I'll get you a new elephant.
Ivory Dealer: I'll take that one, too.
Homer Simpson: Done.
Ivory Dealer: All right, I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy.
Homer Simpson: Here's the keys.
Ivory Dealer: Elephants don't have keys.
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) I'll just keep these then.
(Simpson Backyard: Ext. Simpson backyard - night)
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) Don't worry, Stampy. I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer.
Bart Simpson: You and I are gonna run away together. We'll keep to the back roads, and make our way South. Then, if I know my geography, it's just twelve miles to Africa. Okay bud, very quietly, let's just sneak through...
Bart Simpson: Stampy!
(Flanders Bedroom: int. Flanders bedroom - continuous)
Ned Flanders: It's the Four Elephants of the Apocalypse!
Maude Flanders: That's horsemen, Ned.
Ned Flanders: Well, gettin' closer.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson House - Master Bedroom)
Lisa Simpson: Mom! Dad! Bart and Stampy are gone!
Marge Simpson: Oh my Lord!
Lisa Simpson: (TO HOMER) I'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad.
Homer Simpson: He took Bart too?
Homer Simpson: (YELLING) That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't PAAAAART!!
(Springfield Streets: Ext. Springfield streets - night)
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) Piece of cake. All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.

Selma Bouvier: Ditto.

Homer Simpson: (CONDESCENDING) Elephant, honey. It's an elephant. And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano.
Foreman: Oh! This is the moment we've feared, people. Many of you thought it would never happen. But I insisted we spend two hours every morning training for it. You all thought I was mad. Many of you requested to be transferred to another peanut factory. But now...
(QUIET SPRINGFIELD STREET: Ext. quiet Springfield street)
Bart Simpson: (CALLING) Stampy! Stampy! Where are you, boy?
Bart Simpson: (HOPEFUL GASP)
(Somewhere: Ext. Somewhere)
Speaker Box: These prehistoric creatures blundered into the tar pits, which preserved their skeletons in showroom condition.
Bart Simpson: (MOANS) He's gone forever.
Bart Simpson: (GASP) Stampy!
Bart Simpson: Ahhh. You're lonely for other elephants, aren't you?
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Lisa Simpson: A deer!
Marge Simpson: A female deer.
Homer Simpson: Son, you're okay! And you've led us to the precious ivory. And of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to...
Bart Simpson: Dad, I can't let you sell him. Stampy and I are friends.
Bart Simpson: Ow. Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge.
Homer Simpson: Forget it. That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?
Homer Simpson: (STOUTLY) I'd like it fine.
Bart Simpson: Even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
Homer Simpson: Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that? To be part of the Music Scene...
Lisa Simpson: Dad! You're sinking!
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Marge Simpson: Get a rope, Bart!
Homer Simpson: Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out. First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out.
Homer Simpson: Now I'll pull my arms out with my face...
Lisa Simpson: Dad!
Marge Simpson: Homie!
Bart Simpson: Stampy, quick! Pull him out!
Barney Gumble: Thanks, Stampy.
Barney Gumble: Ow!
Homer Simpson: (GASPING FOR BREATH) I'm alive! I'm alive. And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, feline means cat.
Lisa Simpson: (EXASPERATED) Dad!
Homer Simpson: (OFF THEIR LOOKS) Oh, I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my life. (QUICK AFTERTHOUGHT) And, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.
Bart Simpson: Thanks, Dad.
Homer Simpson: On the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products.
Homer Simpson: All right. We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
Lisa Simpson: (CHEER)
Bart Simpson: Uh, Mom. We're stuck to Dad.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR) This is just what happened at the caramel factory.
Lisa Simpson: Ow! My hair!
Homer Simpson: Mmm. Caramel.
(SPRINGFIELD ANIMAL REFUGE: Ext. Springfield animal refuge - next day)
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) So long Stampy. I know you're gonna like it here.
Bart Simpson: No, Stampy. No!
Bart Simpson: (MOVED) Ah, thanks, boy.
Bart Simpson: Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Bart Simpson: Atta boy, Stampy. Butt 'em once for me!
Marge Simpson: Gosh, I thought he'd be happier in his true habitat.
Wildlife Man: Oh, I think he is.
Marge Simpson: Then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
Wildlife Man: Well, animals are a lot like people, Mrs. Simpson. Some of them act badly because they've had a hard life or have been mistreated. But, like people, some of them are just jerks. (BEAT) Stop that, Mr. Simpson.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: Int. power plant - day)
Homer Simpson: (YAWNS) Lousy job. Nothing exciting ever happens.

Homer Simpson: Woo hoo! What do I get?
GAME SHOW MAN: The job of industrial chimney sweep for a day!
Homer Simpson: (BEAT, THEN) Woo hoo!

Teenage Burns: Dance!
Greenpeace Hippie #1: All right, we're finally gonna stop those corporate pigs from dumping that nuclear waste.
Greenpeace Hippie #2: Oh no, our boat is sinking.
C. Montgomery Burns: It was I, you fools! The man you trusted isn't Wavy Gravy at all! (RIPS OFF WIG)
C. Montgomery Burns: And all this time I've been smoking harmless tobacco.
Waylon Smithers: I got a mink shammy, sir. I hope that... Oh my god, Mr. Burns is dead! (KNEELING AT TUB, HYSTERICAL) Why do the good always die so young?!
C. Montgomery Burns: You almost killed me!
Waylon Smithers: (CHOKING) Please... sir! You'll catch (GASP) cold.
(Burns's Office: Int. burns' office - a while later)
C. Montgomery Burns: (PENSIVE) Smithers, do you realize, if I had died there would be no one to carry on my legacy? Due to my hectic schedule and lethargic sperm, I never fathered an heir. Now I have no one to leave my enormous fortune to. No one.
Waylon Smithers: (LOUD THROAT CLEARING NOISE)
C. Montgomery Burns: You, Smithers? Oh no, my dear friend, I've planned a far greater reward for you. When I pass on, you shall be buried alive with me.

C. Montgomery Burns: Auditions will be tomorrow at my estate. And now, our feature presentation.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh for... (ANNOYED) Oh, very well.

(Burns Manor: Ext. burns mansion - establishing - evening)
Chief Wiggum: Now what are the two things? Enunciate and energate.
Seymour Skinner: I know, Mother.
Milhouse Van Houten: (HEARTFELT) I have nothing to offer you but my love.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO SMITHERS) I specifically said "No geeks!"
Milhouse Van Houten: (PATHETIC) But my mom says I'm cool.
C. Montgomery Burns: Next.
Nelson Muntz: (MENACING) Gimme your fortune or I'll pound your withered old face in.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, I like his energy. Put him on the call back list.
Martin Prince: (SINGING) CLANG, CLANG, CLANG WENT THE TROLLEY / RING, RING, RING WENT THE BELL / ZING, ZING, ZING WENT MY HEARTSTRINGS...
C. Montgomery Burns: Thank you. (TO SMITHERS) Give the bully an extra point.
Lisa Simpson: I propose to you that your heir need not be a boy. In this phallocentric society of ours...
C. Montgomery Burns: I don't know what "phallocentric" means, but no girls.
Milhouse Van Houten: So much for Plan B.
Homer Simpson: That's it, boy. You're our last hope.
Bart Simpson: (GROANS) I just don't want to be here, Dad. Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on.
Marge Simpson: Bart, this isn't the kind of thing I normally would think was a good idea, but you wouldn't have to live with Mr. Burns, you'd just get all of his money someday. This could provide for your entire future.
Professor: Congratulations, you've just graduated from the most expensive and therefore best school there is.
Lee Majors: Hello, Marge, I'm Lee Majors. Will you come away with me?
Marge Simpson: Uh, sure.
Marge Simpson: (TO HERSELF) I've gotta stop fantasizing about Lee Majors. (BEAT) Ah, one more. (CLOSES EYES, BIONIC SOUND EFFECT)
Homer Simpson: Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. Just read it and you're a shoo-in.
Bart Simpson: (READING CARDS) Hello, Mr... Kurns? I bad want... money now. Me sick.
Homer Simpson: Oooh. He card reads good.
Bart Simpson: So pick, please, me... Mr. Burns.
Homer Simpson: It's KURNS, stupid!
Marge Simpson: (IRRITATED) No it's not.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) Disregard.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, he's the worst yet! That's it! Everyone out! (TO BART) Except you! One step to the left.
Bart Simpson: Ow!
C. Montgomery Burns: (TENTING FINGERS) Excellent.
Homer Simpson: (LAUGHS) The boot kicked Bart. It kicked him right in the butt. (LAUGHS)
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Marge Simpson: I think Bart and Lisa are feeling a little upset right now. Isn't there something you'd like to say?
Homer Simpson: There sure is. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. (TO SELF, CHUCKLES) Right in the butt. (CHUCKLES) That was great.
Bart Simpson: (MOANS)
(Burns Manor: INT. BURN'S MANSION - UPSTAIRS DEN)
C. Montgomery Burns: It's no use. I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the Egg Advisory Council. Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap lately, you know, Smithers.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ooh look, a bird has become petrified and lost its sense of direction.
Waylon Smithers: I think it's a rock, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, we'll see what the lab has to say about that.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why that rapscallion is breaking all my windows.
(Burns Manor: Ext. burns mansion - continuous)
(Mansion: Int. mansion - upstairs den - continuous)
C. Montgomery Burns: Look Smithers, a creature of pure malevolence. He's the perfect one to suckle at my proverbial teat.
C. Montgomery Burns: You there, boy! What day is this?
Street Urchin: (COCKNEY ACCENT) Today? Sir, why it's Christmas day.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANNOYED) I was talking to him. (POINTS TO BART) You, what day is this?
Bart Simpson: (LOOKING UP) Huh?
C. Montgomery Burns: I'll tell you what day it is. Today is the day you become my heir!
C. Montgomery Burns: (SHAKING IT OFF) Ooh, I like him a lot.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - ESTABLISHING)
C. Montgomery Burns: Just sign here and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate.
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo! We're rich! Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. We want to get the old people smell out before we move in.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet.
Homer Simpson: Huh? Oh, right. (TO BURNS) So I guess you're in okay shape, huh? No heart problems or anything...
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, I --
Homer Simpson: (LUNGING AT BURNS) Boo!
Grampa Simpson: (STRICKEN GROAN) I'm okay.
Homer Simpson: (RAVENOUS EATING NOISES) Oh, yeah. So good...
Bart Simpson: (DAWNING, TO HIMSELF) That explains his mysterious trip to Holland.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now that you've all agreed to reap the windfall of my death, I must return to my large empty mansion to rattle around and await the inevitable... alone.
Marge Simpson: (SOTTO) Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, let's push him down the steps.
Marge Simpson: No. (TO BART) You know, Bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him.
Bart Simpson: (RELUCTANTLY) Well...
Marge Simpson: C'mon, honey.
Bart Simpson: All right.
Homer Simpson: (WHINY) How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?
(Burns Manor: Ext. burns mansion - establishing - evening)
C. Montgomery Burns: Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of (MAKING AIR QUOTES) "booger man," but I'm really not such a bad "dude." (NOTICING) Oh, your milk's gone cold. I'll ring for the maid.
Bart Simpson: Whoa.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES) Sorry. Wrong button.
Bart Simpson: Um, uh, I think I'd like to go home.
C. Montgomery Burns: Aw, if you stay you can have anything you want to eat, even some sort of gelatin dish. It's made from hooves, you know.
Bart Simpson: (CALMING DOWN) Anything, huh? (CHALLENGING) Okay... I want pizza, and I want it delivered by Krusty the Clown.
Krusty the Clown: Hey, it's Krusty the pizza man! (KRUSTY LAUGH) -- (TO BURNS) All right, where's my four hundred bucks?
Bart Simpson: Hey, wait! How can you be here when your show's on live?
Krusty the Clown: Ah, I just threw on an old rerun. No one will know the difference.
Krusty the Clown: (SMALL GASP) Children, remain calm. The Falkland Islands have just been invaded! I repeat, the Falklands have just been invaded.
Krusty the Clown: The disputed islands lie here, off the coast of Argentina.
Krusty the Clown: (GROANS)
(ANOTHER BASEMENT ROOM: Int. another basement room)
C. Montgomery Burns: This is my pride and joy. I've had hidden cameras planted in every home in Springfield. I got the idea from that movie "Sliver." What a delightful romp!
Moe Szyslak: (MENACING) Are you talkin' to me? There's no one else here. You must be talkin' to me.
Moe Szyslak: Well that was an antique. Crap.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY)
Bart Simpson: ...And I had the greatest time. (EXCITED) Mr. Burns' house has everything - a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors, and a bottomless pit.
Lisa Simpson: It couldn't possibly be bottomless.
Bart Simpson: Well, for all intents and purposes.
(Simpson Dining Room: Int. Simpson dining room - night)
Lisa Simpson: Hey Mom, Bart's throwing peas.
Marge Simpson: Bart, don't throw peas at your sister.
Bart Simpson: Mr. Burns throws peas at Smithers.
Lisa Simpson: Ow! That was a big one.
Marge Simpson: Homer, say something.
Homer Simpson: Okay. (STERNLY) Lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Bart Simpson: (RE: HIS PLATE) Oh yuck, meatloaf! My most hated of all loafs.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) That was the end piece. That's it! Being abusive to your family is one thing but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. Go to your room!
Bart Simpson: No! This family stinks. Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side. I'm suffocating here.
Homer Simpson: (LAMELY) Bart, you listen.
Bart Simpson: Oh, go eat some flowers.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) My secret shame.
(Burns Manor: Ext. burns mansion - a while later)
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, my plan worked perfectly. Bart Simpson will live here as my son, and I will mold him in my own graven image. Who knows, I may even grow to love him. (THROWS OPEN DOOR) Bartholomew!
C. Montgomery Burns: (GRIMACING) Ugh! Smithers get it off me.
Homer Simpson: Bart, you're coming home.
Bart Simpson: I want to stay here with Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO HOMER) I suggest you leave immediately.
Homer Simpson: (COCKY) Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst.
Homer Simpson: (UPSET) He locked the door! (BEAT) I'll show him.
(Springfield Police Station: Int. Police station)
Marge Simpson: I'm very concerned. Mr. Burns has stolen our son and he won't give him back.
Chief Wiggum: (ANNOYED) Oh for gosh, can't you people solve these problems yourselves? I mean we can't be uh (AIR QUOTES) "Policing" the whole city.
Lionel Hutz: (NAILS IN MOUTH) Damn clogs. (THEN, TO SIMPSONS) Well you good folks can rest easy now because you've come to the very best in legal representation.
Seymour Skinner: Uh, excuse me, is there an Orange Julius stand on this floor?
Lionel Hutz: I'll sell you this one. It's almost full.
Seymour Skinner: (SARCASTIC) Well why don't I drink out of a toilet bowl?
Lionel Hutz: He'll be back. (TO MARGE AND HOMER) And as for your case - don't you worry. I've argued in front of every judge in the state. Often as a lawyer.
(MUNICIPAL COURTROOM: Int. municipal courtroom - day)
Judge Snyder: (SLAMS GAVEL) This court rules in favor of Montgomery Burns. I find that he is clearly the boy's biological father.
Lionel Hutz: Uh, judge, these won't be ready until Thursday.
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) You know we should really stop hiring him.
(Burns Manor: Int. burns' mansion - day)
Milhouse Van Houten: Cool train. Where's it go?
Bart Simpson: Beats me. But it won't be back for three hours and forty minutes. Once it had snow on it.
Milhouse Van Houten: Wow, Bart! Mr. Burns gives you everything you could ever want. My parents use that old love excuse to screw me out of toys. Well, I'm sure you'd like to be alone with your possessions.
Bart Simpson: (SEARCHING) Uh, Milhouse, if you stay a little while longer, you can have this blazer. (INDICATES HIS JACKET) It's a Bob Mackie original.
Milhouse Van Houten: Wow, a Bob Mackie! (THEN) ...Sorry, Bart.
C. Montgomery Burns: Bartholomew, you don't need him. I can be your schoolyard chum!
(Burns Manor: Ext. burns mansion - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Five, twenty-three skidoo! Hut! Hut!
Bart Simpson: For me? But I don't know how to drive.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, pish posh. There's a jaws of life in the trunk.
(Sports Car: Int. sports car - Bart's POV)
Bart Simpson: (RELIEVED SIGH) That was some ride.
Elf: (MIDGET VOICE) You're telling me.
(Office: Int. office - day)
Deprogrammer: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, your son has clearly been brainwashed by the evil and charismatic Mr. Burns.
Marge Simpson: Are you sure you can get him back for us?
Deprogrammer: Absolutely. I'm the one who successfully deprogrammed Jane Fonda, you know.
Marge Simpson: What about Peter Fonda?
Deprogrammer: (WEARY SIGH, THEN) That was a heartbreaker. But I did get Paul McCartney out of "Wings."
Homer Simpson: You idiot! He was the most talented one!
(Cheap Motel: Ext. cheap motel - night)
Deprogrammer: You do not love Mr. Burns. You love Homer and Marge! You are their son!
Deprogrammer: What you are doing is wrong... wrong... wrong!
Mayor Joe Quimby: Do you mind? You're killing the romance in here.
Deprogrammer: Well, it was a grueling two weeks but you have your son back.
Hans Moleman: (MONOTONE) Mom, Dad, I missed you.
Marge Simpson: Homer, that's Hans Moleman.
Homer Simpson: Can I keep him anyway? Huh, huh?
(Burns Manor: Int. burns mansion - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: That was delightful! Did you see that? That mouse butchered that cat like a hog! Is all TV this wonderful?
Bart Simpson: Um, I'd kind of like to go home now.
C. Montgomery Burns: (STILL LAUGHING) Like a hog! (THEN) Heh? What? What was that?
Bart Simpson: Mr. Burns, I don't want to seem ungrateful. But, I want to go home to my family.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SADLY) I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this, but... I'm afraid your family doesn't want you back.
(BASEMENT ROOM: Int. basement room - moments later)
"Homer": I do not miss Bart at all.
"Marge": I am glad he's gone.
"Lisa": As am I.
"Homer": (ANNOYED) B'oh!
Bart Simpson: It's probably my imagination but something about them didn't seem quite right.
C. Montgomery Burns: Really? Excuse me for just a moment.
(NEXT ROOM: Int. next room - continuous)
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRY) People, that was all wrong. Homer Simpson doesn't say "B'oh!" he says... (CONSULTS A SCRIPT) "D'oh!"
Homer Actor: (BRITISH ACCENT) Sorry, M.B., but I'm having trouble with this character. Is he supposed to have some kind of neurological impairment like "Rainman," or "Awakenings"? I mean, what the Hell am I doing here?
Marge Actress: And this dialogue has none of the wit and sparkle of "Murphy Brown."
Lisa Actress: Hey, ya know, we're getting into golden-time here.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, well, just get it right or you'll all be back doing "Come Blow your Horn" at the Westport Dinner Theater!
C. Montgomery Burns: All right then, let's see what the old Simpson family is up to now.
"Homer": D'oh!
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) That's them all right. I can't believe it. I guess you're the only one I can trust...
Bart Simpson: (TENTATIVELY) ... Dad.
C. Montgomery Burns: (PATTING RIB) That rib always breaks.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - establishing - day)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, what are you doing?
Lisa Simpson: Just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction that Bart's absence has left in our hearts.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMS)
Marge Simpson: That's sweet, honey.
(Burns's Office: Int. burns office - day)
Bart Simpson: It's a little tight.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, that's to correct your posture. (PATTING BART ON THE BACK) Soon you'll have a mighty hump.
C. Montgomery Burns: (MOVED) Now, you really are my son. This calls for a celebration. Let's fire some employees.
Bart Simpson: Excellent.
C. Montgomery Burns: Okay, let's make this sporting, Leonard. If you can tell me why I shouldn't fire you, without using the letter "E," you can keep your job.
Lenny Leonard: (NERVOUS) Uh, okay... um... I'm a good... work... guy.
C. Montgomery Burns: You're fired.
Lenny Leonard: But I didn't say --
C. Montgomery Burns: You will.
Lenny Leonard: Eeeeeeeeeeeee!!
Bart Simpson: (CHUCKLING) Let me try one.
Homer Simpson: Hey, the trail of donuts ended. (GASPS) Bart!
Bart Simpson: (GASPS) Homer!
C. Montgomery Burns: (LYING) Huh! What a coincidence. And a perfect opportunity for you to prove your loyalty. Go ahead Bartholomew. You may fire when ready.
C. Montgomery Burns: (LOSING PATIENCE) Hurry! Fire him now or I'll disown you. You'll lose everything. The fabulous toys, a lifetime of wealth and luxury, the gift certificate from Blockbuster Video, the freedom to do whatever you want.
Homer Simpson: I'll miss you, son.
Bart Simpson: I'm sorry, Dad... You're fired!
C. Montgomery Burns: (STUNNED) What? Fire me? That does it, you can never be my son...
Bart Simpson: A little to the left.
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh? Oh, very well. (CONTINUING) You can never be my...
Waylon Smithers: (YELLING) Sir, try to land on Leonard's carcass!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - day)
Homer Simpson: Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV saying we didn't want you in our family. But those were just actors playing us.
Bart Simpson: (STUNNED) How do you know?
Homer Simpson: Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, me too. That midget taught me a lot about his native Estonia.
Marge Simpson: The point is the real Simpson family missed you a lot and we're really glad you're home.
Bart Simpson: (TO EVERYONE) I love you guys.
Homer Simpson: Right back atcha, son. Aw.
Homer Simpson: And now I want you to meet your new brother, Hans Moleman.
Hans Moleman: Cowabunga, dudes.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) Give it a try. It's like kissing a peanut. Heh, heh, heh.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED) Homer, I want that thing out of my house.
Bart Simpson: (CHUCKLE) They're gonna eat this up at Show and Tell.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - morning)
Marge Simpson: I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the idea of your classmates laughing at our family's private moments. How would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were laughing at things you did?
Bart Simpson: Not likely. C'mon, have a sense of humor about yourself!
Baby Bart: I'm a big boy today.
Lisa Simpson: (DERISIVE LAUGH)
Bart Simpson: (EMBARRASSED GROAN) Argh! I gotta find something else quick!
Marge Simpson: Why don't you bring this potato? It's pretty big.
Bart Simpson: Mom, you're always trying to give me potatoes. What is it with you?
Marge Simpson: I just think they're neat.
(Lisa's Bedroom: int. Lisa's room - a second later)
Bart Simpson: I need something for Show and Tell.
Lisa Simpson: Just take one of my geodes. (OFF HIS LOOK) The rocks on my desk.
Lisa Simpson: No, that's a Trilobite... That's petrified wood... Bart, that's a bran
Lisa Simpson: muffin.
(School Bus: int. school bus - a minute later)
Martin Prince: Greetings, fellow geodologist.
Bart Simpson: (MOAN) I'll be right back.
Nelson Muntz: The ingredients were (READING) "Fresh pureed tomatoes, water, salt, and Sodium Benzoate used to retard spoilage." Once again, if I'm not mistaken, this can contained tomato paste.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Thank you, Nelson. I look forward to seeing it again next week. Bart, you're up.
Bart Simpson: Boys and girls, Mrs. Krabappel, I come before you today to solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries -- What has four legs and ticks?
Milhouse Van Houten: (RAISING HAND) A walking clock?
Nelson Muntz: A walkin'-clock!
Martin Prince: (ASIDE) I'd wager he has some variety of walking clock in that box.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Bart, is it a walking clock?
Bart Simpson: (CONFUSED) What? (BEAT) No, it's my dog!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (DELIGHTED) Oh, he is a gem! Here, boy, would you like these cookies Martin made for me?
Martin Prince: My raisin roundies!
Bart Simpson: My dog's name is Santa's Little Helper. One time he crawled under the house, and when he came out he was covered with ants. Then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water.
Class: Wow!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Thank you, Bart. Great job.
Milhouse Van Houten: (ASIDE, PROUD) I knew the dog before he came to class.
Martin Prince: (DRAMATIC) Ka-Boom!! That, the sound of the thunderous volcanic explosion which gives birth to the magnificent geode! One of nature's most...
Nelson Muntz: You're doin' it wrong. You gotta pet him hard so he can feel it.
Sherri Mackleberry: Looklooklook! The doggie sneezed!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Ha! It thinks it's people!
Groundskeeper Willie: (MUFFLED) Hey, poochie. Poochie-poochie, poochie.
Martin Prince: (CLEARING THROAT) My geode must be acknowledged.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (ANNOYED) Oh, brother. All right, back to Show and Tell. Bart, why don't you put the doggie away.
Class: (GROANS)
Lunchlady Doris: (PROUD) More testicles mean more iron.
Ralph Wiggum: Um, Miss Hoover? There's a dog in the vent.
Miss Hoover: (SKEPTICAL) Ralph, remember the time you said Snagglepuss was outside?
Ralph Wiggum: He was going to the bathroom.
Seymour Skinner: (INTO PHONE) I know Weinstein's parents were upset, Superintendent, but, but ah, I was sure it was a phony excuse. I mean, it sounds so made up: "Yom Kip-pur?" (LAUGH)
Groundskeeper Willie: (PANICKED) Sir, ye've goot to coom quick! There's a doog roonin' aroond in the air doocts!
Seymour Skinner: I understand. (GRABS P.A. MICROPHONE) Children, this is Principal Skinner...
Seymour Skinner: Remain calm. There is a dog in the vents.
Seymour Skinner: (GETTING DOWN) Willie, go into the vent and get him.
Groundskeeper Willie: What?! Have ye gone waxy in yer beester?! I canna fit in the wee vent, ye croquet-playin' mint-muncher!
Seymour Skinner: Grease yourself up and go in, you-you... (THINKING) guff-speaking work-slacker.
Groundskeeper Willie: (SARCASTIC) Ooh. Good coomback.
Groundskeeper Willie: Lunchlady Doris, have ye got any grease?
Lunchlady Doris: Yes. Yes we do.
Groundskeeper Willie: (RIPS OPEN SHIRT) Then grease me up, woman!
Lunchlady Doris: Okey dokey.
Seymour Skinner: Good lord! It's coming up right behind him!
Groundskeeper Willie: (SMALL GASP) What the? No! No! (FRANTIC GIGGLES)
Groundskeeper Willie: (GIGGLING) Ouch! (GIGGLES) Ouch! Stop it!
Seymour Skinner: Children, teachers, back to your rooms! Uh-oh, whenever I get this upset, I get hiccups. (HICCUPS) Ooh, right on cue.
Groundskeeper Willie: Aha! There's nary an animal alive that can outrun a greased Scotsman! Now, out we go.
Groundskeeper Willie: Whoogh! 'Tis more dizzying than the belfry at St. Corgegluynwaagen's! (COOR-GUH-GLOON-WAH-GUNS)
Chief Wiggum: That's nice work, boys.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (LOOKING OUT WINDOW) (SING SONG) Uh-oh. Someone's getting a visit from Superintendent Chalmers.
Seymour Skinner: (HICCUPPING) I (hic) ... can't (hic)... take (hic)... this (hic).
Gary Chalmers: Skinner!
Seymour Skinner: (PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER) Superintendent Chalmers, you didn't have to come all the way down here. Everything's under control.
Gary Chalmers: Ooh, I have had it. I have had it with this school, Skinner: the low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children...
Seymour Skinner: Now, really I hardly think the children's appearance should --
Gary Chalmers: Seymour, you are in very, very big troub--
Gary Chalmers: Huh? Why, looking into this lovable mutt's eyes just melts my heart... Seymour, all is forgiven--
Groundskeeper Willie: (FALLING) Aah! Make way for Willie!
Groundskeeper Willie: I said, 'Make way for Willie,' ye bloated gas-bag!
Gary Chalmers: Seymour?
Seymour Skinner: Hmm?
Gary Chalmers: You're fired.
Bart Simpson: (GASPS)
Seymour Skinner: I'm sorry, (PEEVED) d-did you just call me a liar?
Gary Chalmers: (PUZZLED) No, I said you were fired.
Seymour Skinner: Oh. That's much worse. (BEAT, THEN: HICCUP)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - morning)
Bart Simpson: I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner left, but now all I have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head.
Lisa Simpson: That's guilt. You feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job.
Bart Simpson: (SADLY, FEELING THE BACK OF HIS HEAD) Yeah, I guess it is guilt.
Homer Simpson: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. They let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?
Bart Simpson: Well, yeah, but --
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm off to work.
Marge Simpson: The dog has had enough excitement.
Homer Simpson: (WHINY) But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement.
Homer Simpson: Look! Ree, ree. (LAUGHS) Ree, ree. Aye, aye. (OFF MARGE'S LOOK) All right, all right, I won't take the dog. C'mere.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED MOAN)
(Springfield Elementary School: int. school - auditorium - day)
Gary Chalmers: Boys and girls, because of Mr. Skinner's sudden departure, I've had to appoint a new principal. Leopold?
Leopold: (STERN/MEAN) All right, you little punks, prick up your freaking ears, because I'm only gonna be saying this once. From now on, things are gonna be very, very different around here...
Kids: (GASPS)
Leopold: ...with your new principal, Ned Flanders!
Homer Simpson: How many "s"'s in "innocent"?
Ned Flanders: Well, tippity-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body here! As chairman of the PTA, I Am dee-diddily-lighted to take over, and I think I can put the "pal" back in principal.
Gary Chalmers: (STANDING UP) Yeah, and I'll put the "super" back in superintendent.
Gary Chalmers: (SITTING DOWN; ANNOYED) That's the same exact joke. What gives, Leo?
Ned Flanders: Now I know everybody's eager to get back to class --
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Ha!
Ned Flanders: But I thought it might break the ice if we had a little Q and A.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: (NUDGING JIMBO) Dude, ask a question or we'll have to go back to class.
Jimbo Jones: (NERVOUS) Um...
Ned Flanders: Yeah, you.
Jimbo Jones: Ah, yeah, uh, I was wonderin' d-do you, uh, er, what's your, um, policy, on... um, lunch?
Ned Flanders: Well, let me just say I want to put the "stew" back in students.
Gary Chalmers: It's just a damn popularity contest with you kids.
Leopold: (TO STUDENTS) Now look what you've done you little freaks!
(Kwik-E-Mart: int. kwik-e-mart - day)
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Young men! Your gargantuan cone is making a mockery of our self-serve policy!
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, look. It's Principal Skinner, and I think he's gone crazy. He's not wearing a suit or tie or anything!
Bart Simpson: Principal Skinner... Um, I'm real sorry about my dog getting you fired, and biting you, and then getting it on with your leg.
Seymour Skinner: Well, maybe it was for the best. Now I... I finally have time to do what I've always wanted: write the Great American Novel. (PROUD) Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques!
Seymour Skinner: I call it "Billy and the Clone-o-saurus!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (CAN'T CONTROL HIMSELF, REALLY ANGRY) Oh you have got to be kidding, sir! First, you think of an idea that has already been done! And then, you give it a title that nobody could possibly like!! Didn't you think this thr... it was on the best-seller list for 18 months! And every magazine cover...one of the most popular movies of all time! What were you thinking?! (BEAT) I mean, thank you, come again.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY)
Jurors: (MOAN)
Ned Flanders: Bart, I've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. And now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour.
Bart Simpson: (MOUTH FULL OF PEANUT BUTTER CUPS) Mufft a been a co-in-fa-dince.
Ned Flanders: Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished. This isn't just some sort of club house.
Ned Flanders: Oh, sorry, were you drinking Slice or Yoo-Hoo?
(SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT: INT. SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT - AFTERNOON)
Seymour Skinner: Well, let's see. Tide, Cheer, Bold, Biz, Fab, All, Gain, Wisk. I believe today I will try... Bold.
Seymour Skinner: Bart! How are you? How's school?
Bart Simpson: Um, it's, it's a lot of fun.
Seymour Skinner: (GLUM NOISE)
Bart Simpson: Well, it was good to see you.
Seymour Skinner: (HAPPY) It was? Well, then we should get together again! Uh, say Saturday, at my house. Do you know where I live?
Bart Simpson: (LYING, EYES DARTING) Uh, no.
Seymour Skinner: Hmmm, a flaming bag, eh? Well, these new Italian loafers will make short work of it.
Bart Simpson: Uh, I'm kinda busy on Saturday.
Seymour Skinner: Hey!
Jimbo Jones: We got Skinner's underpants!
Kearney Zzyzwicz: And there's nothing you can do about it, Mr. Ex-Principal.
Seymour Skinner: That's not true. I can buy a new pair. (LOOKS AT WALLET) No, I can't. I needed those. I really did.
(Skinner Home: ext. skinner's house - day)
Agnes Skinner: Oh, you must be Seymour's friend. He's up in his room. Don't touch the wallpaper.
Seymour Skinner: Bum-ba-bum-bum! Ba-ba-ba-bum! (SEES BART) Now a little more allegro than last time. Bart! Welcome! Can I offer you a Diet Caffeine-Free Dr. Pepper or an individual fruit cocktail cup?
Bart Simpson: Uh, no I'll pass. Hey, what's this?
Seymour Skinner: (RE: PHOTO) Oh, that's my old unit from Vietnam. I was their Sergeant, they were my loyal troops.
Seymour Skinner: That photo was taken shortly before I was shot in the back ... Which was very strange, because it was during a Bob Hope show. I was trying to get Joey Heatherton to put on some pants for God's sake.
Agnes Skinner: Seymour! Your friend Bart is here!
Agnes Skinner: Seymour, do you want me to tell you when it's 7:30?
Seymour Skinner: No, Mother.
Seymour Skinner: (UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER) Ned Flanders actually eliminated detention and put the whole school on the honor system?
Bart Simpson: Yeah, and the teachers are afraid to leave the faculty lounge. (CHUCKLES)
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLES) Oh, that place must be falling apart. Oh, mercy. (BEAT) Nobody's mentioned me, have they?
Bart Simpson: Uh, I thought I heard someone say your name in the cafeteria, but they might've been saying "skim milk."
Seymour Skinner: (SATISFIED) Yeah, yeah.
Seymour Skinner: I thought you might like this restaurant, Bart. They'll make a pizza pie with the topping of your choice.
Luigi: Ay, Seymour! You want-a your usual table?
Seymour Skinner: No, no, Luigi, I'd like one with two seats. I'll be dining with a friend tonight.
Luigi: (WAY TOO HAPPY) Ay! Good-a for you!! Ay?
Seymour Skinner: Hmm. They treat you real nice here.
Luigi: Ay, Salvatore! Guess-a who's here? Mr. Cuckoo Labonza, and-a some real ugly kid!
(Springfield Elementary School: int. school - hallway - the next day)
Milhouse Van Houten: This is great. Not only am I not learnin', I'm forgettin' stuff I used to know. And it's all thanks to you, Bart.
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) Yeah, great.
Milhouse Van Houten: What's the matter?
Bart Simpson: Don't you see, Milhouse? We've gone too far. We need Skinner back.
Martin Prince: My water dish is empty!
JANEY: I learned to read because of you, Principal Skinner.
Martin Prince: Sir, I baked you these raisin roundies.
Ralph Wiggum: Principal Skinner, I got car-sick in your office.
(Skinner Home: ext. skinner's house - the next day)
Agnes Skinner: Oh, you're Seymour's friend. Here, he left you this note.
Seymour Skinner: "Dear Bart, your friendship during this difficult time will not be forgotten. However, I've decided to return to the only thing besides school that has ever given my life meaning -- I've re-enlisted in the United States Army. Sincerely, Sgt. Seymour Skinner."
(ITALIAN RESTAURANT: Int. Italian Restaurant - night)
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) Table for one.
Luigi: Aw, you miss-a your friend, eh? Don't you worry. My cookin', she'll a-cheer you up.
Luigi: Ay, Salvatore, give-a the ugly kid a plate-a the red crap!
(Fort Springfield: Ext. Fort Springfield - day)
Colonel: It's good to have another combat veteran around here. I myself received a number of medals for uh securing that Montgomery Ward in Kuwait City.
Seymour Skinner: Hmm. Yes, Colonel. Now, I understand it will be my duty to mold the new recruits into a well-disciplined, highly-trained infantry unit.
Colonel: Sure, I, I guess. Here they come.
Hayseed #1: Hi. Where do I get my grenades at?
Hayseed #2: Hey, they don't have them group terlets here no more, do they?
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. School - principal's office - day)
Marge Simpson: Ned, Homer and I are a little concerned with the way the school's being run.
Homer Simpson: (SNACKING FURIOUSLY FROM STUFF ON NED'S DESK; MOUTH FULL) Yes, deeply concerned.
Ned Flanders: Well, I may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick, but that's, that's because my dad was so hard on me when I was a boy.
Ned Flanders: Woopsy-doodle.
Flanders's Beatnik Dad: (DICK SHAWN VOICE) Oh maaan! Ned spilled ink all over my poems! He's a real flat tire, I mean a cube, man! He's putting us on the train to Squaresville, Mona!
(Fort Springfield: Ext. Fort Springfield - training grounds - day)
Company: (SINGING) I MET A WOMAN IN PARIS, FRANCE /HAD A BIG HOLE IN HER UNDERPA--
Seymour Skinner: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where did you pick up that filth?! (MILITARY SHOUTS)
Private: We heard Sergeant Clark's company singing it, sir!
Seymour Skinner: Yes, well, there will be no smut in my company. You're in this man's army to learn!
Company: (SINGING) I DON'T KNOW, BUT I BEEN TOLD! / THE PARTHENON IS MIGHTY OLD!
Seymour Skinner: (SINGING) Howwww old?
Company: (SINGING) WE DON'T KNOW!
Seymour Skinner: (SINGING) WELL, THAT'S REAL GOOD, BUT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson House - Living Room - night)
Lisa Simpson: Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner could become any more of a square, but there's the proof.
Bart Simpson: It's weird, Lis. I miss him as a friend, but I miss him even more as an enemy.
Lisa Simpson: I think you need Skinner, Bart. Everybody needs a nemesis. Sherlock Holmes had his Dr. Moriarty. Mountain Dew has its Mello-Yello. Even Maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow.
(Fort Springfield: EXT. FORT SPRINGFIELD - FRONT GATE - DAY)
Seymour Skinner: Man on the range!! Change your trajectories!!!
(Kwik-E-Mart: Ext. Kwik-E-Mart - THAT MINUTE)

(Fort Springfield: Ext. fort Springfield - a minute later)
Bart Simpson: If there was some way to get rid of Flanders, would you want to come back?
Seymour Skinner: Uh, I must admit, I do miss the school. And uh, frankly, the Army isn't quite as I remembered it.
Rowdy Soldier: Up yours, sergeant!
Seymour Skinner: Actually, it's exactly as I remembered it. (BEAT) I do want to come back, Bart, but it doesn't sound like Flanders is gonna get fired.
Bart Simpson: Oh, I think I can get him fired. I got you fired, didn't I? (CHUCKLES)
Seymour Skinner: ...Yes. (BEAT) Now you realize, if I become Principal again, we can no longer be friends. Unless you become a good student.
Bart Simpson: Hmm, that's probably never gonna happen.
Seymour Skinner: (WISTFUL) Well, we'll always have the laun-dro-mat.
Bart Simpson: (WISTFULLY) Yeah.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - Bart's room - Night)
Seymour Skinner: (RE: HOMER) What's he doing here?
Bart Simpson: Well, once he found out we were going to get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping.
Homer Simpson: (NODDING, CALMLY) That is true.
Bart Simpson: Here's the plan. Once Chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten, he'll fire Ned on the spot.
Seymour Skinner: Yeah, well one question remains. How do I get out of the army?
Bart Simpson: No problem-o. Just make a pass at your commanding officer.
Seymour Skinner: Done and done. And I mean done.
Marge Simpson: (KNOCKING ON DOOR) What's going on in there?
Seymour Skinner: Nothing!
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. School - Bart's classroom - a minute later)
Martin Prince: (SINGING) TO-READOR EN GARDE...
Bart Simpson: C'mon, Chalmie. You fired Skinner for less than this.
Gary Chalmers: Yeah, I did, but Skinner really bugged me. Besides, the way America's public schools are sliding, they'll all be this way in a few months. I say lay back and enjoy it. It's a helluva toboggan ride.
Ned Flanders: Well, cockily-Doodily-Doo, little buddies. Let's thank the Lord for another beautiful school day.
Gary Chalmers: Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord? That sounded like a prayer! A prayer. A prayer in a public school!! God has no place within these walls, just like facts have no place within organized religion! Simpson, you get your wish. Flanders is history.
Ned Flanders: Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent. May the Lord bless and keep you.
Gary Chalmers: Now take it outside, God-boy.
Ned Flanders: Okily-dokily.
Seymour Skinner: Dirksen, tuck in your shirt. Jaffee, spit out that gum.
Leopold: (TO CHALMERS) You really think it's a good idea to just give that freak his job back?
Gary Chalmers: (DOESN'T CARE) Eh. He seems to know the students' names.
Bart Simpson: So I guess we're enemies again.
Seymour Skinner: I guess. (BEAT) Thanks, Bart.
Bart Simpson: (SNEAKY CHUCKLE) Sure.
Seymour Skinner: Oh, mercy.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - morning)
Bart Simpson: (MOANS) How can they imprison kids in school on a beautiful day like this?
Lisa Simpson: They're not "imprisoning us," Bart. They're...
(Prison Bus: Int. prison bus)
Bart Simpson: (CONFUSED) A prison bus, Otto?
Otto Mann: The regular school bus broke down, so take a seat before I blow your heads off.
Lisa Simpson: (SHOCKED) Otto!
Otto Mann: Oh, sorry. This bus and I have sort of a "Shining" thing goin' on.
Bart Simpson: (DEEP BREATH) Ah! This is what being a kid is all about. (LOW) Hey, Huck. What's (SPELLING IT) L-I-N-C-O-N doin' here?
Huck: I dunno. It's your fantasy.

Bart Simpson: Ah, the joys of mortgaging your future.
Bart Simpson: (GASP) My fantasy's come true.
Lincoln Hobo: (SINISTER) Hey kid. Wanna see a dead body?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well, children, our new ultra-hard Posturific chairs have arrived. They've been designed by eminent posturologists to eliminate slouching by the year three thousand.
Martin Prince: Ms. Krabappel, I'm having back spasms.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (CHUCKLES) I know they seem a little uncomfortable right now, but eventually your bones will change shape.
Milhouse Van Houten: (RAISING HIS HAND) I've lost all feeling in the left side of my body.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Yeah, yeah. Now, unfortunately, our school clocks have been running fast all semester. So today we all have to stay two extra hours to make up for the time we lost. Ha!
Freddy: And to think I got all this after dropping out of the fourth grade! Ha, ha!
Bart Simpson: That does it. I'm outta here.
Bart Simpson: Mrs. Krabappel, I have to go to the dentist. I have a caraway seed caught under my bridgework.
Bart Simpson: My mom's number is on there if you want to check up on me.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (SLYLY) That's okay, Bart. I trust you.
(Skinner's Office: Int. Skinner's office)

Seymour Skinner: (DISAPPOINTED) Hmm, inconclusive.

(Springfield Elementary School: Int. school - Bart's class)
Groundskeeper Willie: Spill it! Where's yer brither?
Seymour Skinner: You'd better answer him, Lisa. He's a bad man.
Seymour Skinner: What are you laughing about?
Lisa Simpson: You started off as the bad cop. But now you're the good one. You and Willie got mixed up about ten minutes ago.
Seymour Skinner: We did not! Now where's Bart? You better tell me!
Groundskeeper Willie: Ach. You'd better tell him, lassie. I canna control him when he gets like this.
Lisa Simpson: (LAUGHING) Now you're the good cop.

Rainier Wolfcastle: Maria, my mighty heart is breaking. I'll be in the Humvee.
Freddy: Hey, what the hell is this?

(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson home)
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR) It says Freddy Quimby beat a waiter half to death. Those Quimby children are so wild and rich. I hope he finally gets what's coming to him.
Bart Simpson: (BLURTING) But Freddy Quimby's innocent.
Lisa Simpson: How do you know? (RE: PAPER) There weren't any witnesses.
Bart Simpson: (COVERING) Oh, yeah. Right.
Lisa Simpson: You'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party like that.
Everyone: Guilty.
Bart Simpson: (GUILTILY) Well they didn't, okay? They didn't! It says right here in black and white, no witnesses. Case closed. Now let's all read the funnies.
Bart Simpson: Oh look, Charlie Brown said "Good grief." (WEAK LAUGH) I didn't see that comin'. (UNEASY LAUGH)
(School Bus: Int. School bus - later)
Bart Simpson: Lisa, I gotta tell somebody. I was at the Quimby compound yesterday when that frog waiter got whacked. I know that Freddy Quimby is innocent.
Lisa Simpson: You're a witness? Bart, you have to tell the police.
Bart Simpson: I can't.
Lisa Simpson: Why?
Seymour Skinner: Bart Simpson, I know you cut school yesterday. And as soon as I can prove it, I'm shipping you off to the Christian Military Reform School.
Bart Simpson: What he said.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, I see. If you testify, Skinner will know you skipped school. Well, if Freddy Quimby didn't do it, I'm sure he'll be found innocent by a fair and impartial jury.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house)
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Jury duty. I'll see that Quimby kid hang for this.

Announcer #2: Let's go over to the county courthouse live to Kent Brockman.
Kent Brockman: Brockman, just outside the county courtroom where an argument about chowder has spilled over into the biggest trial in Springfield history. Behind these doors, a Federal judge will ladle out steaming bowls of rich, creamy justice in a case the media have dubbed... "Beat Up Waiter." (MAKES A DISGUSTED FACE) This reporter suggested "Waiter Gate" but was shouted down at the press club. Now it's illegal to televise court proceedings in this state, (LOWERING VOICE) so we'll have to be quiet.
(Courtroom: Int. courtroom)
Seymour Skinner: I know you can read my thoughts, Bart. Just a little reminder: if I find out you cut class, your ass is mine. Yes, you heard me. I think words I would never say.
Homer Simpson: I know you can read my thoughts, boy. (SING TO MEOW MIX THEME) Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow/ meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Quimby's Lawyer: I intend to prove that Freddy Quimby is totally innocent. First of all, his accuser is a very shady character. (POINTING) That waiter, Mr. LaCoste not only wasn't born in Springfield. He wasn't even born in this country!
Moe Szyslak: Uh, Freddy Quimby was with me the entire night in question. We were collecting canned goods for the starving people in, ah... you know, one of them loser countries.
Audience: (MURMURS) "He's clearly innocent."
Moe Szyslak: (NERVOUSLY) Oh, good. My laundry is done.
Bart Simpson: Ya see, Lisa? They don't need my testimony.
Lisa Simpson: (DERISIVE) Only because Mayor Quimby's buying his nephew's freedom.
Bart Simpson: (HAPPY SIGH) The system works. Just ask Claus Von Bulow.
Lionel Hutz: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to prove to you not only that Freddy Quimby is guilty, but that he is also innocent of not being guilty. (GESTURING) I refer you to my expert witness, Doctor Hibbert.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, only one in two million people has what we call the "evil gene." Hitler had it. Walt Disney had it. And Freddy Quimby has it. (CHUCKLE)
Lionel Hutz: Thank you, Doctor Hibbert. I rest my case.
Judge Snyder: (STARTLED) You rest your case?
Lionel Hutz: What? Oh, no. I thought that was just a figure of speech. Case closed.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Excuse me, your honor. Yes, I'd like to bring something to the court's attention.
Homer Simpson: (ASLEEP GURGLING NOISE)
Homer Simpson: (WAKING) Huh?
Judge Snyder: Give those glasses to the bailiff.
Homer Simpson: All right.
Judge Snyder: And those.
Quimby's Lawyer: Your honor, even though I've proven my client's innocence, I'd still like to call Freddy Quimby to the stand so that we can all bask in his gentle decency.
Audience: "He's wealthy, therefore inherently good." "He's definitely innocent." (ETC.)
Quimby's Lawyer: Mr. Quimby, did you assault Mr. LaCoste?
Freddy: Of course not. I love each and every uh living thing on God's green earth.
Quimby's Lawyer: Therefore, you certainly would never lose your temper over something as trivial as the pronunciation of "chowder."
Freddy: That's chowda. Chowda! I'll kill you. I'll kill all of you - especially those of you in the jury.
Quimby's Lawyer: (DEPRESSED) Wow, that didn't go well. The defense rests.
Judge Snyder: Will the jury retire and come to its decision?
Homer Simpson: Okay, fine.
Helen Lovejoy: This won't take long. He's clearly guilty. We'll probably be home by dinnertime.
Jasper Beardly: Good. I heard the dog from "Frasier" is gonna ride the dolphin on "Seaquest."
Lisa Simpson: Well Bart, because of you, a horrible, yet innocent person is going to jail.
Bart Simpson: (GROAN) Maybe I should come forward.
Seymour Skinner: (TO OTHER JURORS) I can't wait 'til the sentencing part. That's where I really shine.
Seymour Skinner: Bart Simpson, for the heinous crime of hooky, I sentence you to a lifetime of hard labor in the cafeteria.
Lunchlady Bart: More creamed corn, Jimbo Junior?
JIMBO JR.: This creamed corn tastes like creamed crap.
Lunchlady Bart: Watch the potty mouth, honey.
Judge Snyder: Your sister says you have something to tell me.
Bart Simpson: What? Uh, um, yeah. Uh, I just want to say how great it is to finally see some chicks on the bench.
Judge Snyder: Hm.
Bart Simpson: Keep up the good work, toots. (SHEEPISH LAUGH)
Lisa Simpson: (WEAK LAUGH) Chicks on the bench... (WEAK LAUGH)
(JURY ROOM: Int. jury room)
Jasper Beardly: Why bother votin'? He's guilty.
Ned Flanders: We might as well make it official.
Homer Simpson: What does sequestered mean?
Seymour Skinner: If the jury is deadlocked, they're put up in a hotel together so they can't communicate with the outside world.
Homer Simpson: What does deadlocked mean?
Seymour Skinner: It's when the jury can't agree on a verdict.
Homer Simpson: Uh-huh. And "if"?
Seymour Skinner: A conjunction meaning "in the event that" or "on condition that."
Homer Simpson: So "if" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be "deadlocked" and have to be "sequestered" in the Springfield Palace Hotel.
Patty Bouvier: That's not gonna happen, Homer.
Jasper Beardly: Let's vote. My liver is failing.
Homer Simpson: Where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free HBO - Oooh, "Free Willy!"
Seymour Skinner: Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson. It has little, if anything, to do with a disobedient whale. Now let's vote.
Homer Simpson: Uh, how are the rest of you voting?
Homer Simpson: (SOMBERLY) I'm only doing what I think is right. I believe Freddie Quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.
(Springfield Palace Hotel: ext. Springfield palace hotel - establishing)
(Hotel: Int. hotel - homer & Skinner's room)
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Oh, I miss you too, Marge. But the law needs me. I'll be home as soon as I can.
Homer Simpson: Room service? Send up two more pot roasts and three more pillows with mints on 'em.
Seymour Skinner: You know, (SMALL CHUCKLE) we're kind of like the original "Odd Couple." You're the messy one and I'm...
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Shut up.
Seymour Skinner: Oh yes, very well.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house)
Lisa Simpson: So Bart, have your insides been gnawed away by guilt, yet?
Bart Simpson: Sell it to Hallmark, sis. You're lookin' at cucumber boy. As in "cool as a."
Announcer: Next on McGarnigal - McGarnigal is framed for a crime he didn't commit. And only one witness can clear his name - a little sissy boy who's too scared to come forward.
MCGARNIGAL: You gotta tell 'em what you saw, Billy.
Billy: But I'm so scared, McGarnigal.
MCGARNIGAL: You gotta do this one for me, Billy. McGarnigal.
Billy: Okay. For you. McGarnigal.
Chief Wiggum: (DISGUSTED) Well, McGarnigal, Billy is dead. They slit his throat from ear to ear.
MCGARNIGAL: Hey, I'm tryin' to eat lunch here!
(Hotel: Int. hotel - homer's room)
Homer Simpson: (CHOKED UP) Jump, Free Willy, jump! Jump with all your might!
Mother: Oh, no. Willie didn't make it. And he crushed our boy.
Man: Ew, What a mess.
Homer Simpson: (MOAN) I don't like this new director's cut.
(Homer's Room: Int. Homer's Room - Later)
Homer Simpson: Got it, Barn?
Barney Gumble: Got what?
Barney Gumble: Ow!
Seymour Skinner: You're stealing a table?
Homer Simpson: I'm not stealing it. Hotels expect you to take a few things. It's a souvenir.
Seymour Skinner: Ah. Is that my necktie you're wearing?
Homer Simpson: Souvenir.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house)
Bart Simpson: Mom, what if there's a really bad, crummy guy who's going to jail, but I know he's innocent?
Marge Simpson: Well, Bart, your Uncle Arthur used to have a saying, "Shoot 'em all and let God sort 'em out." Unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice. It took seventy-five Federal marshals to bring him down. Now, let's never speak of him again.
Bart Simpson: Mom, Mom, Mom!
Marge Simpson: Hmm?
Bart Simpson: What if I can get this guy off the hook. Sh-should I do it?
Marge Simpson: Honey, you should listen to your heart, and not the voices in your head, like a certain uncle did one grey December morn.
(Courtroom: Int. courtroom)
Judge Snyder: Even though reopening a trial at this point is illegal and grossly unconstitutional, I just can't say no to kids.
Quimby's Lawyer: So, young man. If Freddy Quimby didn't inflict these injuries on Mr. LaCoste, just who did?
Bart Simpson: Well, I was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened...
Freddy: Say it, Frenchie! Say chowder!
French Waiter: Ne-verr!
Freddy: Okay, you asked for it. I'm gonna enjoy this.
Bart Simpson: (SINCERELY) And that's what really happened.
French Waiter: I keel you! I am not a clumsy Clouseau-esque waiter. I will...
French Waiter: At least there were no big traps.
French Waiter: (LITTLE WHIMPER)
Lionel Hutz: How could you have seen all this, Bart? Weren't you supposed to be in school?
Bart Simpson: (DEEP BREATH) I sorta skipped school.
Seymour Skinner: I knew it! I knew you'd slip up sooner or later, Simpson.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: What slip up? What are you talking about? He confessed it.
Seymour Skinner: Quiet. I need this.
Judge Snyder: This court finds Freddy Quimby innocent of all charges. Case dismissed.
(Courthouse: Ext. courthouse)
Seymour Skinner: Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there. You testified for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in a noose. On the other hand, you skipped school.
Bart Simpson: I guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?
Seymour Skinner: (DEEP BREATH) I'm a small man in some ways, Bart. A small, petty man. Three months detention.
Seymour Skinner: Wait a minute, Bart.
Seymour Skinner: Make that four months detention.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - establishing - night)
Homer Simpson: Well, Marge, it was horrible. Everyone was against me in that jury room. But I stood by the courage of my convictions and I prevailed. And that's why we had Chinese food for lunch.
Marge Simpson: Good for you, Homie. You know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone.
Homer Simpson: Great, Marge. I wanna hear all about it. (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: Give me those...
Homer Simpson: (MOAN)
Marge Simpson: (CRUSHING SOUND) And those.
Homer Simpson: (MOAN)
Marge Simpson: (CRUSHING SOUND) And those!
Homer Simpson: (MOAN)
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGH)
Sideshow Mel: Please, Krusty, this is very demeaning.
Krusty the Clown: Shuddup and conduct!
Monkeys: (KAZOO VERSION OF "BLUE DANUBE WALTZ")
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - rumpus room - day)
Lisa Simpson: (LAUGH)
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Maggie, can you point to the monkey?
Homer Simpson: Pfft. What do babies know?
Lisa Simpson: Maggie, can you point to the credenza?
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Marge Simpson: Homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting Maggie's birthday cake.
Homer Simpson: What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? (BEAT) Oh.
Marge Simpson: Hey, hey, hey hey, stop it! I made a special cake for you to ruin. It's over there.
Homer Simpson: (HAND FLOURISH À LA WIMPY) Ooh.
Patty Bouvier: Hello, everyone except Homer.
Jacqueline Bouvier: Happy birthday, granddaughter!
Patty Bouvier: Marge, I think that's your father-in-law across the street.
Grampa Simpson: (DISTANT) Hap-py Birthday!
Marge Simpson: Everybody get ready! Here comes the birthday girl in her very first dress!
Everyone: Aww!
Patty Bouvier: She's a little angel!
Selma Bouvier: Yeah. I wanna put a hook in her and hang her from our Christmas tree.
Grampa Simpson: (BEAT, SCOWLING) Whaaaat smells?!
Marge Simpson: (LOOKING DOWN AT MAGGIE) Uh-oh.
Bart Simpson: Shouldn't we wait for the other babies before we open the presents?
C. Montgomery Burns: Guess what happened to me last night!
Lisa Simpson: We didn't invite the other babies. Maggie doesn't seem to get along with the other babies.
Marge Simpson: Maggie, we have a surprise for you.
Maggie Simpson: (SCARED SOUNDS)
Grampa Simpson: Oo! Put some Lister's Carbolic Unguent on a wad of cotton. Put the cotton in her ear. That'll stop them shakes.
Jacqueline Bouvier: No, no. What she needs is a Balsam Specific.
Grampa Simpson: Balsam Specific? While we're burning money, why don't we give her a Curative Galvanic Belt, too?
Bart Simpson: (ESEOLD VOICE) Don't forget to give her Smeckler's Powder!
Jacqueline Bouvier: Don't make fun.
Jacqueline Bouvier: I remember Lisa's third birthday. She and Bart did this adorable little song and dance routine.
Grampa Simpson: Oh, (LAUGHS) that was a real horn-honker! Let's see it!
Bart Simpson: (GROAN)
Grampa Simpson: Now! Do it!
Lisa Simpson: (GROAN AGAIN)
Grampa Simpson: (MENACING) Do it!
Lisa Simpson: (SINGING, LIFELESS) HOT DOGS / ARMOUR HOT DOGS...
Grampa Simpson: Sing it like you mean it!
Lisa Simpson: (SINGING) WHAT KINDS OF KIDS EAT ARMOUR HOT DOGS?
Bart Simpson: (DEEP FAT KID'S VOICE) FAT KIDS...
Lisa Simpson: SKINNY KIDS...
Bart Simpson: (MAKING CLIMBING MOTION) KIDS WHO CLIMB ON ROCKS...
Lisa Simpson: (TOUCH VOICE) TOUGH KIDS...
Bart Simpson: (WIMPY VOICE) SISSY KIDS...
Milhouse Van Houten: EVEN KIDS WITH CHICKEN POX!
Everyone: LOVE HOT DOGS / ARRR-MOUR HOT DOGS (BIG FINISH) THE DOGS KIDS LOVE TO BITE!
Lisa Simpson: Doesn't this family know any songs that aren't commercials?
Everyone: (SINGING) I FEEL LIKE CHICKEN TONIGHT! / LIKE CHICKEN TONIGHT! / LIKE CHICKEN TONIGHT!
Jacqueline Bouvier: (SIGH) It's been great spending time with my family again. (SADLY) I guess the next time I see you won't be until Thanksgiving.
Homer Simpson: (OILY) Or, if not then, Christmas.
Grampa Simpson: (SIGH) I suppose I'll be gettin' home, too. At least I got Matlock to keep me company. (LOOKS AT WATCH) Ooh! He's on in five minutes!
Jacqueline Bouvier: (PANICKED) He is?! Step on it!
Old Jewish Man: Hurry up! Hurry! Each Matlock could be our last!
Marge Simpson: Homey, you know, it's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely.
Homer Simpson: Hee, hee, hee, hee. That is funny.
Marge Simpson: Yeah. Anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or shopping, or to that room in the library that's always full of old people. "Periodicals," that's it.
Homer Simpson: Marge, please. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.
Marge Simpson: Homer, would you please stop reading that Ross Perot pamphlet?!
Homer Simpson: Oh.
(Homer's Car: Int. Homer's car - day - the next weekend)
Marge Simpson: (PHONY, TO GRAMPA) Say! I've got a neat idea. Why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner.
Grampa Simpson: I'll be back in a jiffy.
Marge Simpson: That's not my mother.
Grampa Simpson: I'll be back in a jiffy.
Old Woman: Can I come, too?
Old Woman: (SAD NOISE)
(Restaurant: Ext. Restaurant - day - an hour later)
Marge Simpson: You know, Mom, you and Abe have a lot in common. (SEARCHING) Umm, you both got swindled by that telemarketing scam.
Grampa Simpson: Oh, it's not a swindle. What you do is, see, you give 'em all your credit card numbers, and if one of them is lucky, they'll send you a prize!
Jacqueline Bouvier: (SADLY) I was just happy to talk to someone on the phone.
Grampa Simpson: Aw, feelin' blue, eh? I got somethin' that'll cheer you up.
Lawyer: Sir, I represent the estate of Charles Chaplin. I have a court order demanding an immediate halt to this unauthorized imitation. Boys?
(Bouvier Apartment: Int. Bouvier Apartment - living room - later)
Jacqueline Bouvier: And here's a picture of me getting arrested for indecent exposure. It was the most embarrassing day of my life.
Grampa Simpson: (WOLF WHISTLE) Lamp those gams! You were one nifty number!
Jacqueline Bouvier: Boys all paid attention to me and it drove my friends crazy.
Grampa Simpson: Oh? Who were your friends?
Jacqueline Bouvier: Oh, Zelda Fitzgerald... Frances Farmer... and little Sylvia Plath...
Waylon Smithers: (A BIT SNIDE) I don't know, Sir. You had sex with that old woman?
Grampa Simpson: (A BIT SMITTEN) Y'know, you remind me of a poem I can't remember... and a song that may never have existed... and a place I'm not sure I've ever been to.
Jacqueline Bouvier: You're so sweet.
Grampa's Brain: I feel all funny! (GASP) I'm in love! (BEAT) No, wait, it's a stroke!
(Street: Ext. Street - day)
Grampa Simpson: No, wait. It is love!
Grampa Simpson: I'm in looove!

Announcer: (VERY QUICK) Not a guarantee.
Bart Simpson: Ooh.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - hallway - a minute later)
Bart Simpson: (STILTED) Pardon me, sir. Forgive my clumsiness.
Homer Simpson: (QUICKLY) Not at all.
Bart Simpson: (TRYING TO SOUND LIKE AN ADULT) Ah, yes, my name is Homer Simpson, and I'd like to order an Itchy an Scratchy cel. My credit card? (LOOKING) Ah, do you accept the Federal Breast Inspector's card? License to Ogle? Viza?... Oh yes, of course, that's what I meant, Visa. It's these new dentures.
Marge Simpson: Well, I think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother.
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm opposed to the whole thing! Damn opposed!
Bart Simpson: He's damn opposed! Damn! Damn! Damn opposed!
Marge Simpson: Bart! Homer, what possible reason could you have against Grampa being in love?
Homer Simpson: If he marries your mother, Marge, we'll be brother and sister! And then our kids, they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Mom? (BEAT) Fine. You know, Abe had a very nice time with you last Sunday...
Grampa Simpson: Tell her I love her!!!
Marge Simpson: (COVERING PHONE) Grampa, sssh! I know my mother. If you come on too strong, she's going to get scared away.
Grampa Simpson: I love ya!

Bart Simpson: Um... that's me.
Teenager: Stop stealing golf balls from the driving range!

Bart Simpson: (THROUGH DOOR) Go away!
Wiseguy: If you do not open the door, Mr. Simpson, I cannot give you your (BEAT) "special delivery."

Delivery Man: (WISE GUY VOICE) That's for keepin' me waitin'!
Bart Simpson: Hey, Lis, guess who's got a genuine Itchy and Scratchy animation cel?!
Lisa Simpson: (THRILLED) Oh. That is so cool, that is so exciting, that is so... (BEAT: SEES THE CEL; VERY QUIETLY) crappy.

Grampa Simpson: Hot diggity! I'm gonna smooch her like a mule eatin' an apple! (REPULSIVE KISSY SOUNDS) I even bought me some special novelty dentures.
Homer Simpson: Dad, that will never work. If you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool.
Homer Simpson: (COOL JAZZ RHYTHM) NOW, WHAT YOU GOTTA DO / IF YOU WANT TO GET A KISS / IS ACT REAL SMOOTH / AND MAKE YOUR MOVE LIKE THIS.
Grampa Simpson: Oh, I see. (COOL JAZZ RHYTHM) SO IF I TAKE YOUR ADVICE / AND MAKE YOUR PATENTED MOVE / THEN MY CHANCES FOR LOVE / WILL SLIGHTLY IMPROVE?

Bart Simpson: Is this cel worth anything?
Comic Book Guy: (SNIFFS) Let me show you something.
Comic Book Guy: This, this is a Snagglepuss drawn by Hig Heisler. It is worth something. (POINTS TO BART'S CEL) This, this is an arm drawn by nobody. It is worth nothing.
Bart Simpson: Can't you give me anything for it?
Comic Book Guy: I can give you this telephone. It is shaped like Mary Worth.

Lawyer: Yes. That would be acceptable.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: Ext. NUCLEAR PLANT - BURNS' OFfICE - THE NEXT DAY)
C. Montgomery Burns: (ELATED) Smithers...

(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - foyer - night)
Marge Simpson: Mom's almost ready for her date. She sure seems taken by this new beau. I feel so bad for Grampa.
Homer Simpson: Dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him.
Marge Simpson: (SCREAM)
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello! Why it's... it's uh... oh it's...
C. Montgomery Burns: Why it's Fred Flintstone and his lovely wife, Wilma! (RE: MAGGIE) Oh, and this must be little Pebbles! Mind if I come in? I brought chocolates.
Homer Simpson: (GRABS CHOCOLATES) Yabba-dabba-doo!
Marge Simpson: He's an awful, awful, awful man, but I guess if he makes Mom happy, that's all that really matters.
Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) That's right, money. Your money's happiness is all that moneys.

Homer Simpson: Ew yuuuuck!
Marge Simpson: What about Abe Simpson? Don't you have any feelings for him?
Jacqueline Bouvier: Ah, he's a dear, but he's too much of an old fusspot.

(Street: ext. street - that minute)

Bart Simpson: Yeah, but his reply envelope just had a check to the Gas Company in it.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: ...and so, when Eliphaz (ELLA-FAZZ) came down from Mt. Hebron bearing figs, he offered them to Moham, who you will remember as the father of Shecham, and to Hazar (HAY-ZAR) on the occasion of their matrimony. Much in the same--
C. Montgomery Burns: (IMPATIENT) We've heard enough about Blizblaz and Himham already! Get to the bloody point!
Marge Simpson: Hm? Hm?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Do you, Charles Montgomery Burns, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
C. Montgomery Burns: I do.
C. Montgomery Burns: (LOUD ANGRY WHISPER) The ring, you little imbecile! Before I really lose my temper!
Jacqueline Bouvier: (SOTTO, TO MARGE) I know, I know.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?
Jacqueline Bouvier: Oh, Monty! My favorite song. How did--
C. Montgomery Burns: (IRATE) I specifically requested no romantic music!
Grampa Simpson: Mrs. Bouvier! Mrs. Bouvier!
Grampa Simpson: Mrs. Bouvier!
Grampa Simpson: Honey, are ya sure ya wanna be Mrs. Montgomery Burns? Wouldn't ya rather be Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?
Jacqueline Bouvier: (LIKE HE'S CRAZY) No!
Grampa Simpson: (SAD NOISE)
Jacqueline Bouvier: (BEAT) I don't want to be either.
Grampa Simpson: Hot ziggity zam! That's good enough for me!
(SENIOR CITIZEN'S MINIBUS: int. senior citizen's minibus - a few minutes later)
Grampa Simpson: Turn off that racket!
Otto Mann: Yeah, fat chance, pops.
Singers: HELLO GRAMPA MY OLD FRIEND / YOUR BUSY DAY IS AT AN END / YOUR EXPLOITS HAVE BEEN SAD AND BORING / THEY TELL A TALE THAT'S WORTH IGNOR-ING / WHEN YOU'RE ALONE / THE WORDS OF YOUR STORY WILL ECHO DOWN THE RESTROOM HALL / 'CAUSE NO ONE AT ALL / CAN STAND THE SOUND OF GRAM-PAAA....
Grampa Simpson: I first took a fancy to Mrs. Bouvier because her raspy voice reminded me of my old Victrola. Oh, it was a fine machine. When the vulcanized rubber listening tube was just crammed in your ear. The tube would go in easier with some sort of lubricant like Linseed oil or Dr. Some...
Grampa Simpson: I'm sorry.
(Lenny's House: Ext. Lenny's house - night establishing)
Moe Szyslak: All right, I raise a quarter.
Carl Carlson: I'm out.
Lenny Leonard: I'm out.
Barney Gumble: I'm out.
Moe Szyslak: Homer, do you want any cards? Homer?
Homer Simpson: Whew. (EXPLAINING) Don't try to eat these so-called "chips."
Lenny Leonard: Do you want another card or not?
Homer Simpson: Huh? Oh. Okay. I'll take three.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) (ANNOYED GRUNT) (ANNOYED GRUNT) (THEN, SLYLY) I mean, woo hoo!
Moe Szyslak: I'm in. Let's see your cards.
Homer Simpson: (GROAN) I was bluffing.
Moe Szyslak: (LAUGHS) Come to papa... Wait a minute! You have a straight flush, Homer. Go! You do this every time. You... oh, you, ah, ... I'm choking on my own rage here.
Carl Carlson: (GENTLY) Hey, don't yell at Homer. Just because he's a little slow...
Homer Simpson: (JUMPING UP) How dare you call me that?!
Lenny Leonard: Hey, Homer, you still here? Boy, you are slow.
Lenny Leonard: Get the hell outta here.
(Simpson Kitchen: Int. Simpson Kitchen - morning)
Homer Simpson: So, anyhoo, last night, we're playing poker, right. As usual, I'm winning and not realizing it. And Lenny says that I'm uh... (CHUCKLES) get this... (CHUCKLES) "A little slow."
Homer Simpson: How come you're not laughing? Do you think I'm slow?
Bart Simpson: Buh.
Lisa Simpson: Sneh.
Maggie Simpson: (TWO SLOW, NON COMMITTAL SUCKS)
Marge Simpson: We don't think you're slow. But, on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything.
Homer Simpson: You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge. They won't let me. One quality show after another. Each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. But they won't, they won't let me live!
(Bedroom: Int. bedroom - night - continuous)
Homer Simpson: (MOAN) Oh, who am I kidding? I am slow...
Marge Simpson: Oh Homie, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better.
Homer Simpson: Take another bath in malt liquor?
Marge Simpson: ... There's that. Or, you could take an adult education course.
Homer Simpson: (BITTERLY) Oh, and how is "education" supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine making course and I forgot how to drive?
Marge Simpson: (OUTRAGED) That's because you were drunk!
Homer Simpson: (WISTFULLY) And how.
(Adult Education Annex: Ext. adult education annex - establishing)
Patty Bouvier: One way to drive your man wild is to wear tight, revealing clothes.
Class: Eww!
Patty Bouvier: At this point, I'd like to remind you there are no refunds.
Moe Szyslak: All right, here's the four one one, folks. Say some gangsta is dissin' your fly girl. You just give him one of these.
Lenny Leonard: See that ping sound means the spit was on target. Now you try.
Grampa Simpson: (MOAN)
Lenny Leonard: (TRYING TO BE POSITIVE) Gettin' better!
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class. Look at the way they admire and adore him.
Homer Simpson: That's it! If he can teach a class, he can teach a class. (BEAT) I mean, I can teach a class.
Administrator: What is your area of expertise?
Homer Simpson: Well... I can tell the difference between butter and "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."
Administrator: No you can't, Mr. Simpson. No one can.
Homer Simpson: (GROAN) I've failed again. Everybody can teach a class but me. I'm an idiot. What am I gonna tell my wife and kids?
Administrator: Oh, you're married?
Homer Simpson: (FLIRTATIOUSLY) That depends. Is there another way to get this job?
Administrator: No, Mr. Simpson, what I mean is, we may have a job for you after all. We need someone to teach a course on how to build a successful marriage.
Homer Simpson: I'll do it! Anything to get me out of that house, away from all that nagging and noise... (REALIZING; TO ADMINISTRATOR) Of a family of love. (SINGING) Sha la la la.
(Simpson Kitchen: Int. Simpsons' kitchen - evening)
Homer Simpson: Look, everyone! Now that I'm a teacher, I've sewed patches on my elbows.
Marge Simpson: Homer, that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer, not the other way around. You've ruined a perfectly good jacket.
Homer Simpson: (PROUDLY) Incorrect, Marge. Two perfectly good jackets.
Lisa Simpson: I think it's great you're a teacher, Dad. So, will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more Socratic method of interactive class participation?
Homer Simpson: (PATRONIZING) Yes, Lisa. Daddy's a teacher.
(Flanders Home: Ext. Flanders' house)
Ned Flanders: Well, Homer, what a pleasant...
Homer Simpson: Can't talk now, Flanders. (SMUGLY) I've got a class to teach.
Ned Flanders: But you rang my...
(Street: Ext. Street)
Squeaky-Voiced Teen: Can I take your order?
Homer Simpson: Nothing for me, today! I've got a class to teach!
SQUEAKY-VOICED TEENAGER: (FILTERED) Sir, it's a felony to tease the order box.
Homer Simpson: It's all right! I'm a teacher.
Miss Hoover: I didn't know we could do that!
(CLASSROOM: Int. classroom - later)
Homer Simpson: (TO CLASS) All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class.
Homer Simpson: Down the hall, room twelve.
Man: (MOUTH FULL) Thank you.
Homer Simpson: Ew. Okay, let's get started. (THINKING SOUNDS)
Homer Simpson: (CURTLY) No talking. (MORE THINKING SOUNDS)
Seymour Skinner: (THEN; FINALLY) Um, how about if we tell you our problems with relationships?
Homer Simpson: (WARMING TO IT) Yeah, yeah. That'll eat up some time. Uh, how 'bout you, Otto.
Otto Mann: My standards are just too high, you know. I feel like nobody's good enough for me.
Otto Mann: (NOTICING) Whoa. You think you got 'em all but you forget about the eggs.
Lionel Hutz: My problem is, I'm a real user of women. I move in right away and stay until the money's gone.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I'm a smart woman, but I make bad choices.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (GIGGLES) Okay. Here's a set of house keys and my ATM card.
Waylon Smithers: Um, I was married once, but uh, I just didn't know how to keep it together.
(OLD SOUTHERN MANSION: Int. old southern mansion - bedroom)
Smithers's Wife: (GASP) C'mon, Waylon. Make love to me the way you used to.
Waylon Smithers: No.
Smithers's Wife: It's that horrible Mr. Burns, isn't it?
Waylon Smithers: (ENRAGED) You leave Mr. Burns out of this! You!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers!
C. Montgomery Burns: (À LA BRANDO) Smithers!
Waylon Smithers: (TO HOMER) Mr. Simpson, are you listening?
Waylon Smithers: (YELLING) Simpson!
Homer Simpson: Huh? Yeah, I was listening. Very funny.
Moe Szyslak: You were not! You were just eating a damn orange!
Homer Simpson: Uh, yes, yes. To the untrained eye I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I am making a point about marriage. (A PRONOUNCEMENT) For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange.
Homer Simpson: First you have the skin, then the sweet, sweet innards.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: I don't understand.
Homer Simpson: (SADLY) Okay. But then we've got to get to work.
Groundskeeper Willie: If I wanted to see a man eat an orange, I would have taken the orange eating class.
(CLASSROOM: Int. classroom - simultaneous)
Hans Moleman: The eating of an orange is a lot like a good marriage...
Grampa Simpson: Just eat the damn oranges!
Carl's Wife: This is terrible.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Unbelievable.
Groundskeeper Willie: Let's get out of here.
Seymour Skinner: He's a horrible excuse for an educator.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) I told Marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.
Class: (AD LIB) "In bed?" / "What wouldn't work?"
Moe Szyslak: So something wasn't working in bed, huh? (DERISIVE LAUGH)
Homer Simpson: No, that's not what I meant. Marge and I always talk things over in bed. Like the other night we were fighting about money.
Seymour Skinner: Ooh, a fight.
Moe Szyslak: Trouble in paradise, huh? DERISIVE LAUGH)
Homer Simpson: I was telling Marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Marge dyes her hair?
Homer Simpson: (AND HOW) Oh yeah. She's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.
Sideshow Mel: C'mon, tell us more!
(Somewhere: Ext. somewhere)
Homer Simpson: I went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word. I really think I was born to teach.
Chief Wiggum: All right Simpson, you were warned about teasing the box.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMS)
SQUEAKY-VOICED TEENAGER: (FILTERED, UPSET) Wait! I need closure on that anecdote.
(Kwik-E-Mart: Int. kwik-e-mart - day)
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Uh, Mrs. Simpson, it may interest you to know we are having a sale on blue dye number fifty-two. It is your hair color, I believe.
Marge Simpson: Whatever do you mean? I don't dye my hair... (UNEASY LAUGH)
Moe Szyslak: (TO Apu) Nah, nah, nah, you got it wrong, Pu. She's blue fifty-six.
Marge Simpson: (THROUGH PHONEY SMILE) I don't know what you're talking about. (STARTS TO LEAVE)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (CALLING AFTER HER) We just love your husband's class.
Marge Simpson: That's nice.
(Simpson Master Bedroom: Int. Simpson bedroom - night)
Homer Simpson: Come on, Marge. Let me in! (LOOKING AROUND NERVOUSLY) There's crickets out here.
Marge Simpson: Homer, I really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff.
Marge Simpson: Today at the Kwik-E-Mart everybody knew I dyed my hair.
Homer Simpson: Oh, you mean about you. All right, maybe I said some things -- some personal things. But, you should have seen 'em, Marge. They really wanted to hear what I had to say.
Marge Simpson: (UNINTERESTED) Mm-hmm. I'm happy about that. But, I think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy.
Homer Simpson: (BUILDING INTENSITY) Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order. You're out of order. The whole freakin' system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth. 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge - it's Chinatown.
Marge Simpson: Homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again.
Homer Simpson: (MEEKLY) Yes ma'am.
(CLASSROOM: Int. classroom - evening)
Homer Simpson: Now what is a wedding? Well, Webster's Dictionary describes a wedding as: 'The process of removing weeds from one's garden.'
Moe Szyslak: Tell us more about you and Marge.
Homer Simpson: This is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things.
Carl's Wife: Guess he's run out of stories.
Seymour Skinner: What a rip off.
Otto Mann: I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course! What the heck was that lab fee for?
Homer Simpson: No, wait! Uh, uh, wait!... I, yes! I do have a story about two other young marrieds.
Everyone: (AD-LIBBING) Oh, all right. / Okay.
Homer Simpson: (GOSSIPY) Now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: We need names!
Homer Simpson: Well let's just call 'em uh, "Mr. X" and "Mrs. Y." So anyway, Mr. X would say, 'Marge, If this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't Homer J. Simpson.'
(Simpson Kitchen: Int. Simpson kitchen - the next evening)
Marge Simpson: Homer, don't you have to get to class?
Homer Simpson: Not tonight, Marge. Tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home.
Marge Simpson: Oh, well that will be...
(Simpson Dining Room: Int. Simpson dining room - continuous)
Bart Simpson: (GASPS)
Marge Simpson: What the darn...?
Homer Simpson: Marge, you'll never guess what. My whole class is here. They're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives.
Sideshow Mel: (SNOBBISHLY TO KRABAPPEL: LOUD WHISPER) Apparently that disturbing odor was the food.
Homer Simpson: (BIG, CHEERFUL, A BIT STILTED) So, little Lisa, apple of my eye. How are things down at the ol' schoolhouse?
Lisa Simpson: I find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.
Homer Simpson: (FORCED LAUGH, THEN TO BART) And how's my little major leaguer? Catch any Junebugs today?
Bart Simpson: Well, me and Milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer.
Homer Simpson: (FIRM, BUT LOVING) Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do.
Bart Simpson: What the hell are you talkin' about? You're the one who double dared us.
Homer Simpson: Why you little...
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Bart Simpson: I'm outta here!
Lisa Simpson: Me too.
Homer Simpson: (CHEERFULLY, AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED) Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed...
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) I want this to end now!
Moe Szyslak: Hey, Homer, why don't you just nibble her elbow. That always melts her butter, right? (DERISIVE LAUGH)
Marge Simpson: (MORTIFIED GASP) All right. Okay. Everybody out!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (LEERING) Ooh, she's gotta have it.
Marge Simpson: (YELLING) Get out! Get out! Get out! (ETC.)
Homer Simpson: All right, we're breaking early tonight, class. For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary.
Marge Simpson: You, too.
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Marge Simpson: Get out!
Homer Simpson: But I'm not in the cla...
(Simpson Front Porch: Ext. Simpson front porch - continuous)
Otto Mann: Is any of this gonna be on the test? 'Cause I wasn't paying attention.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - evening - later)
Homer Simpson: Okay, Marge, things were said, mistakes were made. Let's end this madness and get on with our lives.
Marge Simpson: You just don't get it, do you, Homer? You told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. I can't trust you anymore.
Homer Simpson: But, I learned my lesson. It'll never happen again.
Ned Flanders: Hey, Homer, what's the big brouhaha? Ha.
Homer Simpson: Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing.
Homer Simpson: (CALLING) Honey, the door blew shut! (REALIZES) Oh. Fine. That's what you want? You got it. This scene is gettin' old, man. I'm hittin' the road. Maybe I'll drop you a line someday from wherever I wind up in this crazy old world.
(Simpson Backyard: Ext. Simpson back yard - next morning)
(Simpson Kitchen: Int. Simpson kitchen - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Kids, your father and I are going through a really tough time right now. And I don't know what's going to happen, but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much.
Bart Simpson: (WORRIED) Wow, I've never seen Mom so mad at Homer before.
Lisa Simpson: I'll tell you a secret, Bart. Every time I'm worried about Mom and Dad, I go to the attic and add to my ball of string.
(ATTIC: Int. attic)
Snowball II: (YOWL)
(Bart's Treehouse: Ext. Tree house)
Bart Simpson: (INTO WALKIE TALKIE) Earth base, this is commander Bart McCool. We are under attack by the Zorrinid Brain Changers! (TO MILHOUSE) Quickly, into the safety dome, Milbot!
Milhouse Van Houten: (ROBOT VOICE) Affirmative, humanoid.
Homer Simpson: Don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies.
Milhouse Van Houten: (REMOVING HIS HELMET) Sorry, Bart, your dad kinda blew the fantasy. I only like it when I'm pretend scared.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) Keep up the rough-housing, son. Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. (RESUMES SCRUBBING) Oh, these stubborn grass stains.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - day)
Homer Simpson: Oh, good, Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back. He has to push the sanctity of marriage or his God will punish him.
(Simpson Living Room: Int. Simpson living room)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Get a divorce.
Helen Lovejoy: (AGREEING) Mm hm.
Marge Simpson: But, isn't that a sin?

(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house)
(Simpson Master Bedroom: Int. Simpson Bedroom - Night)
Marge Simpson: (SIGH)

(Springfield Street: Ext. Springfield street)
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) Funny... the way everything reminds me of Homer.
Homer Simpson: (ECHOEY) I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm gonna be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together...
Homer Simpson: (CAUGHT, SMALL VOICE) Together?
(Evergreen Terrace: Ext. Simpson street)
(Bart's Treehouse: Ext. tree house - night)
Lisa Simpson: Here, Dad. I brought you some nice... (SMALL SCREAM)
Homer Simpson: Good news, Lisa. I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, that's just a plant.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, you will respect your new mother. Now give her a kiss. Kisss herrr.
Homer Simpson: OhmyGodohmyGodohmyGod. All right, let's get our stories straight. She tripped, right?
Lisa Simpson: Look, I brought you some nice pudding.
Homer Simpson: Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. Oh, I miss Marge. (DESPERATELY) Lisa you're smart. Help me trick her into taking me back.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. (NOBLY) There's a reason two people come together and stay together. There's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. If you want to get Mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can.
Homer Simpson: (BEAT) I'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.
Lisa Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Okay, thirty.
Lisa Simpson: (SINCERELY) Good luck, Dad.
Homer Simpson: All right, brain. It's all up to you. If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever.
Moe Szyslak: Oh, hi-hi, Marge. I heard you and Homer broke up so, um, I'm declaring my intentions to move in on his territory. Here, I uh, brung you some posies.
Marge Simpson: Oh my. I'm very flattered, but I'm not really interested.
Moe Szyslak: (HURT) Geez, I come here, I get dressed up all nice-like, put my heart on the line and I make a fool of myself (VOICE STARTS TO CRACK) Oh boy, I'm gonna start bawling, here.
Marge Simpson: Why don't you come inside for a drink of water?
Moe Szyslak: (CHOKED UP) 'Kay.
Moe Szyslak: (WISTFULLY) Clean house, no silverfish... I coulda been very happy here.
Moe Szyslak: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Moe, what are you doing here?
Moe Szyslak: (STARTING TO EXPLAIN) I uh, well... (PANICKING) I never touched her, Homer. Homer, I swear, I never touched her.
Marge Simpson: Here's your water, Moe.
Moe Szyslak: I didn't ask her for no water. She's lying, Homer, she's lyin'. She told me you were dead. That's the only reason I... I didn't do nothin'!
Homer Simpson: (FRIENDLY) Bye, Moe!
Marge Simpson: Homer, what happened to you?
Homer Simpson: Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can.
Homer Simpson: (WITH FEELING) A bouquet of po... (DEFEATED MOAN)
Homer Simpson: (SAD MOAN) I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.
Homer Simpson: (SAD MOAN) My tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED) Oh, here, let me help you.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute! Wait, that's it! I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence.
Marge Simpson: Homer, that's not a good thing.
Homer Simpson: Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you. I need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you.
Marge Simpson: But, how do I know I can trust you?
Homer Simpson: Marge, look at me! We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours, I'll be dead. I can't afford to lose your trust again.
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR) I must admit, you really do make a gal feel needed.
(Bart's Bedroom: Int. Bart's bedroom - night - a little later)
Homer Simpson: Wait until my class hears about this. (QUICKLY; OFF HER LOOK) Kidding!
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - later)
Homer Simpson: (CONTENTED SIGH) It's great to be indoors with my family.
Lisa Simpson: I'm really glad you're back, Dad. I knew you could do it. (WHISPERS IN HIS EAR) Now don't screw it up.
Bart Simpson: Look, Dad. I missed you so much, I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an "F".
Homer Simpson: Hey, this is dated two weeks ago.
Bart Simpson: Oh, sorry. Here's a fresh one.
Marge Simpson: And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you later tonight.
Homer Simpson: Special present?! (WHINY-CHILDISH) I don't wanna wait! I want it now! I want the children to see. (REALIZING) Oh. Right. Later. (KNOWING LAUGH)

Marge Simpson: Homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. (BEAT) Although I must say, it's certainly refreshing.
Homer Simpson: (PROUDLY) I got the idea when I noticed the refrigerator was cold.
Marge Simpson: Won't this overload the motor?
Homer Simpson: Marge, can you set the oven to cold?
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson House - Living Room - later)

Bart Simpson: So long, Lis. I'm gonna stow away underwater, and go where the pool goes. (EMBRACES HER) Have a good life.
Otto Mann: Sorry, Bart-dude. We gotta fill this thing with Epsom salts and jam it on over to the old folks' home.
Bart Simpson: Oh well. Same time tomorrow, Otto?

Lisa Simpson: Dad...

Lisa Simpson: Dad, as you know, we've been swimming. And we've developed a taste for it. We both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go. Now before you respond, you must understand that your refusal would result in months and months of...
Lisa Simpson: CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? (BUILDING TO A WHINING FRENZY) CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? Canwe... etc.

Homer Simpson: Don't worry boy, when you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer.
(Backyard: Ext. backyard - next day)

Bart Simpson: But you're wearing your glasses.
Milhouse Van Houten: (STONE-WALLING) No, I'm not.
Lisa Simpson: (NOTICING BART, TO JANEY) Oh, look. Bart's all alone. Maybe I should keep him company, at least for a little while.
Kids: Hey, Lisa, watch this! Check it out! (ETC.)
Lisa Simpson: (LAUGH; CALLING) Coming!
Bart Simpson: (BITTER) Aw, great. I get to spend the summer with my brain.
(Bart's Bedroom: Int. Bart's room - later)
Bart Simpson: What fun can you have in a pool, anyway, that you can't have in a bathtub with a garbage bag taped around your cast?
Bart Simpson: Traitors. Go on and have your pool. I'm fine by myself, right here.

Audience: (CHEER)
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS) Hope you enjoyed that, kids, 'cause Krusty's outta here for the summer. In the meantime, we'll be running (ROLLS EYES) (GROANS) "Classic Krusty." Enjoy.

Homer Simpson: (INCREDIBLY LOUD, OBNOXIOUS WHOOP)
Homer Simpson: (DISGUSTED) YAAARR--Ewwwwwww!!

Homer Simpson: Chlorine, eh?
Ralph Wiggum: (RUBBING EYES) My face is on fire!...
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR; LOOKING UP, THEN TO LISA) Oh, look. There's Bart. Wave to him.

Lisa Simpson: Yuh huh. (READING) "Cast of Characters: Viceroy Fizzlebottom, a hearty cherub of a man..."
Bart Simpson: (FURIOUSLY) Gimme that! (GRABS IT AWAY) It's a work in progress. (CHANGING THE SUBJECT) So. How do you like being Miss Popularity?
Lisa Simpson: (RESERVED) Oh, well, y'know, it ain't so great. (OFF HIS LOOK, CONFESSING WILDLY) Bart, it's the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole life! (CATCHING HERSELF) Well, anyway, I brought you a present.
Lisa Simpson: Look, it's the telescope I won at the Optics Festival.
Bart Simpson: (ACIDLY) There was an Optics Festival and I wasn't informed? (GRUFF) You go now.
Lisa Simpson: But...

Bart Simpson: That came from Flanders' house.
Bart Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED GROAN)
Ned Flanders: Ohmygod! What have I done? I've killed her!
Bart Simpson: Can't be what it looks like. This is Flanders we're talkin' about.
Bart Simpson: Ah, I'll just watch some TV.
Krusty the Clown: Now, what you've all been waiting for. Another long "raga" by Ravi Shankar.
RAVI: Shankar.
Krusty the Clown: Shankar. Groovy, man.
Bart Simpson: (GROANS)
Bart Simpson: Uh, uh, noo. This can't be what it looks like. There's gotta be some other explanation.
Ned Flanders: (SIGH) I wish there was some other explanation for this. But there isn't. I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer!
Bart Simpson: Then that's not the real Ned Flanders.
Ned Flanders: I'm a murdiddly-erdiler.
Bart Simpson: If that's not Flanders, he's done his homework!
(Simpson Home: Ext. simpson house - next morning - establishing)
Todd Flanders: Daddy, where's Mommy? We miss her.

(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson House - bart's room - a little later)
Bart Simpson: Listen, Ned Flanders murdered his wife.
Homer Simpson: But why? She's such a fox. (OFF MARGE'S LOOK) I mean, what's on Fox tonight? Something ribald, no doubt.
Marge Simpson: I wish you'd stop spreading bad rumors about people. Remember how you got Grampa tarred and feathered?
Bart Simpson: Sure. That was twenty minutes ago.
Grampa Simpson: Gonna be in the tub for awhile.
(Bart's Bedroom: Int. Bart's bedroom - a little later)
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I'm really sorry I've been ignoring you lately. I got carried away with being popular. But now that I'm unpopular again, I want you to know I'm here for you.
Bart Simpson: You can start makin' it up to me right now. Flanders is leaving the house. I want you to sneak in there and bring me back some evidence... and something sweet for later.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I'm here for you but, I'm not gonna break into somebody's house.
Bart Simpson: (COY) All right. You're right, you're right. Let's-let's just forget about that. Let me read to you from my play. (READING) "Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga? Is it St. Swivens day already?" "'Tis," replied Aunt Helga.
Lisa Simpson: I'm goin', I'm goin!
Bart Simpson: (GASP) A human head!
Bart Simpson: (SIGH) Of course. Oh no. He's back. Flanders is back! Lisa, get outta there!
Bart Simpson: No, Lisa, don't go upstairs. You'll be trapped!
Bart Simpson: An axe! He's got an axe. I'll save you, Lisa!
Bart Simpson: Uh... I'll save you by calling the police.

Ned Flanders: (SHOCKED) Murdered? (GIRLISH SWOON)
(FLANDERS' FRONT YARD: ext. flanders' front yard)
Maude Flanders: Murdered? Oh no, I've just been in the country for a week.
Bart Simpson: (TO NED) But I distinctly heard you say that Maude was with God.
Maude Flanders: Oh, that's right. I was at Bible camp. I was learning how to be more judgmental.
Bart Simpson: (TO NED) But I saw the murder, and then I saw you bury the corpse in the backyard.
Ned Flanders: (BREAKING DOWN) All right. It's true. I am a murderer. I over-watered Maude's favorite ficus plant, I panicked, and then I buried the remains. (OFF MAUDE'S LOOK, MEEKLY) I was hoping to replace it before you got home.
Bart Simpson: (DISBELIEVING) But I heard a woman scream.
Ned Flanders: Huh? Well, now that I can't explain.
Lou: We found it, chief.
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's tavern)
Bart Simpson: Oh, well I guess that explains everything.
Homer Simpson: (SLYLY) Not everything. There's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.
Maude Flanders: (WAVING HER HAND) Um, I'm right here.
Homer Simpson: (DRIPPING SARCASM) Oh, I see. Then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. (OFF THEIR ANNOYED LOOKS) Really, I mean that. Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.
(MARTIN PRINCE'S BACKYARD: Ext. martin prince's backyard - a little later)

Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Lisa Simpson: It's my room and I can do what I want.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah? Well, I can do what I want in my room.

(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson House - Living Room)
Marge Simpson: My, these seas are certainly heaving.
Swashbuckler: Well, no more than your bountiful bosom... M'lady.
Marge Simpson: (GIGGLES; THEN) Does that earring mean you're a pirate?
Swashbuckler: Kinda... Ahhh, the seas have quieted... And only in the sweet embrace of quietude can two lovers truly be as...
Swashbuckler: Ooo, such noise. Ooo, well, I'm done for the evening.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, stop blowing my sex! I mean, stop blowing your sax. Your sax. Stop it.

Miss Hoover: Forty-five seconds 'til "pencils-down."
Ralph Wiggum: (WHISPERING) Lisa, what's the answer to number seven?
Lisa Simpson: (WHISPERING) Sorry, Ralph. That would defeat the purpose of testing as a means of student evaluation.
Ralph Wiggum: (BLINKS BLANKLY) My cat's name is Mittens.
Miss Hoover: Threee, twoo, onne and that's "pencils- down."
Students: (GROAN)
Miss Hoover: Now, here's an oral extra credit question: What was Christopher Columbus actually looking for when he discovered America?
Lisa Simpson: Ooh! Ooh!
Miss Hoover: Anyone besides Lisa for a change?
Ralph Wiggum: Oh! Eh! Eh!
Miss Hoover: Ralph, this better not be about your cat.
Miss Hoover: Oh, aLl right, Li...

(Springfield Elementary School Yard: EXT. SCHOOL YARD - later - recess)
Lisa Simpson: Hi, Allison? I'm Lisa Simpson. Oh, it's great to finally meet someone who converses above the normal eight-year-old-level.
Allison: Actually, I'm seven. I was just skipped ahead because I was getting bored with the first grade.
Lisa Simpson: (UPSET) You're younger than me, too?
Allison: Are you hyperventilating?
Lisa Simpson: (COVERING) No. I just like to smell my lunch... Gee, I never met anyone who skipped a grade before.
Allison: I'm surprised you haven't been skipped. You're obviously smart enough.
Lisa Simpson: Well, I'm sure I could have, but I'd hate to leave behind all my wonderful friends.
Girl #1: Out of the way, brain queen.
Lisa Simpson: Uh! (FRIENDLY) Hey, Sara! (WEAK LAUGH; THEN TO ALLISON) Well, I gotta go. I have to practice for band auditions.

Homer Simpson: Jackknifed sugar truck. (GASPS, BEAT) Sugar?
Homer Simpson: Don't worry, buddy. Here's a quarter. Call for help at the nearest phone... I'll keep an eye on things here.
Hans Moleman: If only this sugar were as sweet as you sir.
Bart Simpson: Homer, that was downright decent of you.
Homer Simpson: We hit the jackpot, here! White gold! Texas tea... sweetener.
Bart Simpson: Dad, isn't this stealing?
Homer Simpson: Read your town charter, boy. (QUOTING) "If food stuffs should touch the ground, said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot." Since I don't see him around, start shoveling.
(Simpson Living Room: Int. Simpson LIVING ROOM - that evening)
Marge Simpson: (DREAMY SIGH)
Lisa Simpson: Mom.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED) What! What?
Lisa Simpson: Why am I still rotting away in the second grade instead of being skipped ahead?
Marge Simpson: I don't know, honey. I guess that's the school's decision to make.
Lisa Simpson: Well, did you ever talk to anyone at the school? Make a few calls on my behalf? Maybe you could've been "nicer" to Principal Skinner, if you know what I mean.
Marge Simpson: Lisa! I am nice.
(Simpson Kitchen: Int. Simpson kitchen)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I really appreciate you making dinner, but this food tastes a little strange.
Lisa Simpson: It hurts my teeth.
Homer Simpson: That's because I've loaded it with sugar!!... Marge, our ship has come in! I found five hundred pounds of sugar (NUDGING BART) -- in the forest -- that I'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. And all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound.
Marge Simpson: But the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound.
Lisa Simpson: And it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it...
Homer Simpson: Those are prizes. (EATS SOME) Ooo, a blasting cap!

Dewey Largo: Oh, that was a close one, Lisa, but you made it!

(Simpson Kitchen: Int. Simpson kitchen - the next day)

Marge Simpson: Well, you'll always be number one to me...
Bart Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT) Hell-o. First born within earshot.
Marge Simpson: Uh... I meant, my number one girl.
Marge Simpson: Oh, for Chri...
Marge Simpson: Honey, if you get too competitive you'll never be happy. No matter how good you are there's always gonna be someone better than you. I always thought I had the tallest hair. But that trip to Graceland really opened my eyes.
Lisa Simpson: But she's better than me at everything that makes me special.
Marge Simpson: Believe me, honey. She's more scared of you than you are of her.
Lisa Simpson: You're thinking of bears, Mom.

(Springfield Elementary School Yard: ext. school yard - later)
Girls: "Brainiac," "Nerd," "You're such a geek-zoid," etc.
Allison: Leave me alone.
Lisa Simpson: (SADLY) Ah, that used to be my face in the mud...
Bart Simpson: I can't stand to see you so miserable, Lis, unless it's from a rubber spider down your dress. Hmmm. That gives me an idea.
Bart Simpson: (INTO TAPE) Note for later. Put rubber spider down Lisa's dress. (SNEAKY CHUCKLE)
Bart Simpson: (MORE SNEAKY CHUCKLES)
Bart Simpson: Hey, I know... How about if I dig up some dirt on Allison? Remember how I got Milhouse's picture on America's Most Wanted?
Fbi #1: There he is on the monkey bars.
Fbi #2: Try to take him alive.
Lisa Simpson: I appreciate the offer, but it goes against every moral fiber in my body.
Bart Simpson: Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's my card.
Lisa Simpson: I don't need a card. You live in the room next to me.
Bart Simpson: (INTO RECORDER) Note: Next year order fewer cards.
(Simpson Kitchen: Int. Simpson kitchen - late afternoon)
Homer Simpson: (GLOATING) And you didn't think I'd make any money. (INDICATING DOLLAR) I found a dollar while I was waiting for the bus.
Marge Simpson: While you were out "earning" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. The plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in Monday.
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo! A four day weekend!
(Lisa's Bedroom: Int. Lisa's room - late afternoon)
Lisa Simpson: Hey, I am above average! So what if Allison's ahead of me? There's no shame in being second.
Announcer: And now, Avis Rent-A-Car is proud to present the second best band in America. Will you welcome Garfunkel, Messina, Oates, and Lisa, singing their number two hit, "Born To Runner Up."
Lisa Simpson: Why would they come to our concert just to boo us?
Bart Simpson: Lis, I did some checkin' on this Allison character and I know it's against all your moral fibers...
Lisa Simpson: (GRABBING PAPER) Give it to me! (LAUGHS EVILLY; THEN DISAPPOINTED) Hey wait, there's nothing bad here.
Bart Simpson: Yep, she's clean as a bean. But, I did tip off the Feds as to the whereabouts of our good friend, Milhouse.
(DRAINAGE TUNNEL: int. drainage tunnel)
Milhouse Van Houten: I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.
Agent: (À LA TOMMY LEE JONES) I don't care.
Milhouse Van Houten: (LONG SCREAM) My glasses!
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) I've got to stop being so petty. I should be Allison's friend, not her competitor. I mean, she is a wonderful person.
Bart Simpson: Way to go, Lis. I mean, why compete with someone who's just gonna kick your butt anyway?
Lisa Simpson: I prefer my phrasing.
(Allison's Living Room: Int. Allison's living room - that evening)
Allison: It's great of you to come over, Lisa. I really want us to be friends.

Lisa Simpson: (MODEST) Oh really? I...
Professor Taylor: Don't be modest. I'm glad we have someone who can join us in our anagram games.
Allison: We take proper names and rearrange the letters to form a description of that person.
Professor Taylor: Like, oh, I dunno, Alec Guiness.
Allison: (AFTER A BEAT) Genuine class.
Professor Taylor: Very good. All right, Lisa. Jeremy Irons.
Lisa Simpson: (AFTER A LONG BEAT) Jeremy's Iron.
Professor Taylor: Uh huh. (A BIT AWKWARDLY) Well, that's very good for a first try. (A BEAT, THEN CHEERFULLY) You know, I have a ball. Perhaps you'd like to bounce it.
(Allison's Playroom: Int. Allison's playroom - later)
Lisa Simpson: What's this?
Allison: Oh, it's for the school diorama competition.
Lisa Simpson: You're finished already? But the competition isn't for weeks.
Allison: Lisa, we're talking dioramas, who could wait? I chose the "The Telltale Heart," by Edgar Allan Poe. See, this is the bedroom where the old man was murdered. And he's buried here, under the floorboards. And look, I used an old metronome to simulate the heartbeat that drove the killer insane. (CHUCKLES) Neat, huh?
Lisa Simpson: (CHUCKLES, NOT MEANING IT) It's great. It's really great.
Professor Taylor: Oh! Got away from you, huh? Well you keep at it.
(Simpson Backyard: INT. SIMPSON BACKYARD - day break)
Homer Simpson: Must... protect... sugar... Thieves everywhere... The strong must protect the sweet... the sweet (SNORES)

Marge Simpson: (WAKING HIM) Homer, Homer!
Homer Simpson: Huh, wha?
Marge Simpson: I want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar. You're being completely paranoid.
Homer Simpson: Oh am I, Am I really?
Homer Simpson: A-ha!
Englishman: Hello.
Homer Simpson: All right, pal. Where'd you get the sugar for that tea?
Englishman: I nicked it when you let your guard down for that split second. And I'd do it again.
Marge Simpson: Homer, when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme?
Homer Simpson: Never! (WITH FEELING) Never, Marge! I can't live the buttoned-down life like you. I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. (WRYLY) Sure I might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. Oh, I'll never be the darling of the so called (SCORNFULLY) "City Fathers" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this Homer Simpson.
Marge Simpson: Look, just get rid of the sugar, okay?
Homer Simpson: No!
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMS) Hey! Get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad!
Homer Simpson: Ow! Ow! Oh, they're defending themselves somehow!
(Lisa's Bedroom: Int. Lisa's room - day)
Lisa Simpson: Look, Bart. It almost killed me, but I hand-crafted all seventy-five characters from Oliver Twist. And now the coup de grace - a bitter snowstorm.
Bart Simpson: Uh oh!
Lisa Simpson: Is it okay?!
Bart Simpson: Well, the important thing is that we survived.
Lisa Simpson: Oh who am I kidding? There's no way I'm ever gonna beat Allison!
Bart Simpson: Well sure there is... (SINISTER)... but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit devious, a bit, as the French say, "Bartesque."
Lisa Simpson: I'll do whatever it takes.
Bart Simpson: Then welcome to the nether regions of the soul. Now here's what we do. Tomorrow morning when Allison comes out of her house, we spray her with the hose, soaking her from head to toe, leaving us relatively dry.
Lisa Simpson: Relatively?
Bart Simpson: Well, there's bound to be some splashback.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, her being wet won't help me win the competition.
Bart Simpson: Well, we could just sabotage her diorama, humiliating her in front of the students and faculty.
Lisa Simpson: Perfect!
Bart Simpson: Leaving her primed for the most traumatic hose-soaking of her life.
Lisa Simpson: Enough with the hose!
(Honey Factory: Ext. honey factory - same day)
Beekeeper #1: Sure is quiet in here today.
Beekeeper #2: Yes, a little too quiet, if you know what I mean.
Beekeeper #1: Hm, I'm afraid I don't.
Beekeeper #2: You see, bees usually make a lot of noise. No noise suggests no bees.
Beekeeper #1: Hm, I understand now.
Beekeeper #1: Oh look, there goes one!
Beekeeper #2: To the Beemobile!
Beekeeper #1: You mean your chevy?
Beekeeper #2: (SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED) Yes.
(Simpson Backyard: Ext. Simpson backyard - a few minutes later)
Beekeeper #1: Ah, very clever, Simpson. Luring our bees to your sugar pile and then selling them back to us at an inflated price.
Homer Simpson: Bees are on the what, now?
Beekeeper #2: Simpson, you diobolical... we're willing to pay you two thousand dollars for the swarm.
Homer Simpson: Deal!
Beekeeper #1: Oh, wait a minute. The bees are leaving.
Homer Simpson: Nooooooo! My sugar is melting! Melting! Oh what a world!
Englishman: (SPIT TAKE)
Homer Simpson: Oh sugar! (SOBS)
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, Homie.
Homer Simpson: It's okay, Marge. I've learned my lesson. A mountain of sugar is too much for one man. It's clear now why God portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in Hawaii.
(Springfield Elementary School Auditorium: INT. school auditorium - the next day)
Seymour Skinner: Ah, Diorama-rama. My favorite school event next to Hearing Test Thursday.
Miss Hoover: "The Grapes of Wrath"? I don't get it.
Nelson Muntz: (POINTING) Here's the grapes. And here's the wrath!!
Nelson Muntz: Haw, haw!
Seymour Skinner: Yes, yes. Very good wrath. (THEN) Ah, let's see, our foreign exchange student, Uter, has chosen "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". Eh... But this is just an empty box!
Üter: (UPSET) I begged you to look at mine first! I begged you!
Bart Simpson: Lisa, here is as the French say, "le fake diorama." I'll create a diversion and you make the switch.
Bart Simpson: (JUMPING UP AND DOWN) Hey, everybody, whoa, look at me. I'm over here. Turn this way right now.
Sherry: Hey, it's Bart!
Milhouse Van Houten: And he's doin' stuff.
Various Kids: Fascinating! Wow! Can't take my eyes off him...etc.
Seymour Skinner: Bart, stop creating a diversion and get out of here!
Bart Simpson: (TWO BIRD SQUAWKS)
Miss Hoover: Okay, our next entry is, "The Telltale Heart" from Allison Taylor.
Seymour Skinner: (RUBBING HANDS TOGETHER) Mm, I can't wait to see this. (SOTTO, TO HOOVER) Be ready with the ribbon.
Children: Eew!
Miss Hoover: (SHUDDERS) What is it?
Bart Simpson: (YELLING IN DISGUISED VOICE) It's a cow's heart. (IN A DIFFERENT DISGUISED VOICE) They're trying to make a monkey outta you!
Seymour Skinner: Allison, is this supposed to be some kind of joke?!
Allison: (NEAR TEARS) I didn't do that! I made a different one!
Seymour Skinner: Oh is that so, young lady? Well, where is this phantom diorama?
Allison: Well, I don't know.
Seymour Skinner: Ah, at least have the guts to take the blame, girl. You're only compounding your folly by lying about it.
Bart Simpson: Right on!
Seymour Skinner: Young lady, cow hearts belong in a butcher's window, not the classroom. Well, maybe in an older student's biology classroom, but that's none of my business. Elementary school is where I wound up and it's too late to do anything about that. (POINTEDLY, TO ALLISON) Frankly, I'm starting to regret skipping you ahead.
Lisa Simpson: (SCREAMS)
Lisa Simpson: It's the beating of that hideous heart! (REGAINING COMPOSURE) I mean, I think I hear something.
Lisa Simpson: Why, here's Allison's real diorama. It got misplaced, ...or so it would seem.
Seymour Skinner: (SUDDENLY CHEERFUL) Oh, well, that changes everything. Let's have a look. (SOTTO, TO HOOVER) Get the ribbon ready.
Seymour Skinner: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh. A little sterile... no real insight. What do you think, Miss Hoover?
Miss Hoover: (MAKING THE 'SO-SO' GESTURE) Eh.
Seymour Skinner: This has been a very disappointing day. All right, on to Lisa Simpson.
Bart Simpson: You're a shoo-in now, Lis.
Lisa Simpson: After the way I've behaved, I don't deserve to win.
Seymour Skinner: Well, this doesn't deserve to win.
Lisa Simpson: (INSULTED) What?
Homer Simpson: Like what?
Seymour Skinner: (GRUMBLES) Oh noW, we're into the dregs. Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry.
Seymour Skinner: Prepackaged "Star Wars" characters still in their display box?! Are those the limited edition action figures?
Ralph Wiggum: What's a diorama?
Seymour Skinner: Why, it's Luke, and Obie-Wan... and my favorite, Chewie. They're all here! (SOTTO, TO HOOVER) What do you think?
Miss Hoover: I think it's lunchtime.
Seymour Skinner: We have a winner!
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. school - AN HOUR LATER)
Lisa Simpson: (SINCERE) I'm really sorry about what I did, Allison. It's no shame being second to you.
Allison: Thank you, Lisa. You know, I'm actually kinda glad I lost. Now I know losing isn't the end of the world. Hey, you still think we can be friends?
Lisa Simpson: Only if we're the best.
Ralph Wiggum: (SINGING TO HIMSELF) I beat the smart kids, I beat the smart kids...
Ralph Wiggum: I bent my Wookies!
Lisa Simpson: Hey, Ralph. Want to come with me and Allison to play anagrams?
Allison: We take proper names and rearrange the letters to form a description of that person.
Ralph Wiggum: (BLINKS BLANKLY) My cat's breath smells like cat food.
(Simpson Home: iNT. sIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: (SNIFFLING) This romance is so full of heartfelt passion. I can really identify with this corn-fed heroine. Homer. Are you awake? This is important, give me some sign you're awake.
Homer Simpson: (BURP)
Marge Simpson: Wake up!
Homer Simpson: Huh? Wuzz wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire?
Marge Simpson: Homie, do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives?
Homer Simpson: (BURP)
Marge Simpson: Wake up!
Homer Simpson: (WHINY) Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!
Marge Simpson: It's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole Saturday drinking beer in Maggie's kiddy pool.
Homer Simpson: There you are. Thought you could get away, huh?
Marge Simpson: I can hit that one pin all right. But the rest of them don't even wobble.
Bart Simpson: You mean "shining."
Marge Simpson: Homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. I want us to deal with the issues raised by this book.
Homer Simpson: Hmmm.
Marge Simpson: I knew I shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
Lisa Simpson: (LAUGH)
Marge Simpson: How many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
Bart Simpson: It's a new episode.
Lisa Simpson: Not exactly. They pieced it together from old shows, and it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth.
Bart Simpson: Really?
Lisa Simpson: Ren and Stimpy do it all the time.
Marge Simpson: Yes, they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about Ren and Stimpy? Children, your father and I have fed you and clothed you, but we've neglected something more important. It's time to learn about love.
Bart Simpson: No need, Mom. We already learned in school.
(CLASSROOM: Int. classroom)
Bart Simpson: Bo-ring.
Kids: (WIDE-EYED) Ew!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (SMOKING) She's faking it.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpsons house)
Marge Simpson: I mean romance not love.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, romance is dead. It was acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney. Homogenized, then sold off piece by piece.
Marge Simpson: That's not true. Romance is all around us. In our neighborhoods...
Marge Simpson: Even on our jobs...
Marge Simpson: All you have to do is think about your most cherished memories.
Bart Simpson: Hmmm.
Bart Simpson: Hello, is Al there?
Moe Szyslak: Al?
Bart Simpson: Yeah, Al. Last name Caholic.
Moe Szyslak: Lemme check. (TO BARFLIES) Phone call for Al, Al Caholic. / Uh, Jacques Strap! / Is I Pee Freely here? / Hey, is there a Butts here? Seymour Butts? Uh, Homer Sexual / My Crotch / A Amanda Huggenkiss? / A Huge Ass / "Ivanna Tinkle" / I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt.
Marge Simpson: No, no, no. No, ask your heart what its fondest desire is.
Homer Simpson: Hm...
Homer Simpson: Mmmm, Chocolate... / Mmmm, invisible cola. / Mmmm, Forbidden donut. / Mmmm sacrilicious. Mmmm, (INDECIPHERABLE) / Mmmm, free goo. Mmmm, something.
Marge Simpson: No, think about people. About moments in your life that have been very romantic.
Homer Simpson: Oh, okay.
Marge Simpson: That's not the idea at all. (THINKS) Okay, well this story isn't ideal, I've never told it to you before.
Marge Simpson: I got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless.
Marge Simpson: So I actually went to the bowling alley to spite him, or her... (MORE CLIPS)
Marge Simpson: (EMBARRASSED) Oh!
Marge Simpson: I'm awfully sorry.
Jacques: Entirely my fault. (PAUSE) It is nice to meet you... (LOOKS AT HER BALL)... Homer.
Marge Simpson: (FLUSTERED) Oh, no, no. Homer is my... ball's name. I'm Marge.
Marge Simpson: (SLIGHT SURPRISED GASP)
Jacques: Your fingers are so slender, so feminine. They are far too tapered for the ball you are using. You need something lighter, more delicate. Here, use my ball.
Marge Simpson: No... no, thank you, Mr... uh... (LOOKS AT THE NAME ON HIS BALL)... Brunswick.
Jacques: Call me Jacques.
Marge Simpson: Jacques.
Jacques: Marge.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm.
Jacques: May I ask you a bold question?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Jacques: You've never bowled before?
Marge Simpson: Never.
Jacques: No?
Marge Simpson: No.
Jacques: Then I will teach you.
Marge Simpson: Oh, I don't want to trouble you.
Jacques: Not at all. I am a professional. Roll the ball for me, Marge. Let me see your form.
Marge Simpson: All right. But I'm not very good.
Jacques: I can help you, Marge. Pick up the ball. Pick up Homer. Pick him up.
Marge Simpson: Oh!
Jacques: Now, throw!
Marge Simpson: But...
Jacques: Throw, damn you!
Marge Simpson: (GASPS) You're a very good teacher!
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - late that night)
Jacques: (HUMMING) Here we are.
Marge Simpson: You didn't have to drop me off.
Jacques: But I wanted to. Marge... Do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight?
Marge Simpson: Oh, Jacques, I'm a married woman.
Jacques: (TORTURED) I know, I know. My mind says stop, but my heart and my hips cry proceed.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Jacques: Marge, darling, I-I want to see you tomorrow. Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
Marge Simpson: What's brunch?
Jacques: You'd love it. It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end. You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal.
Jacques: (HUMMING) Here we are.
Marge Simpson: You didn't have to drop me off.
Jacques: But I wanted to. Marge... Do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight?
(SHORTY'S: Ext. Shorty's)
Marge Simpson: He seemed to know a lot about brunch. But it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all.
Marge Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Jacques: Your laughter is like music to me. But if you laugh at what I say next I will die, for I am about to say something very serious... perhaps shocking. Marge, my darling, I want you to meet with me again.
Marge Simpson: That doesn't shock me.
Jacques: Away from prying eyes. At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace.
Jacques: Marge, speak to me.
Marge Simpson: Is Thursday okay?
Jacques: It's okay indeed.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car)
Marge Simpson: Thank goodness I drove down an ironic street.
Marge Simpson: I made the right decision to stay with my Homie, and there was no harm done. So if you kind of mentally snip out the part where I already had a husband, that's my idea of romance.
Lisa Simpson: Happy Valentine's.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I want you to stop seeing this Jacque. You can let him down gently. But over the next couple of months, I want you to break it off.
Marge Simpson: Okay, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Ooh, that was a close one, kids.
Homer Simpson: Okay, Marge. As long as we're traumatizing the kids, I have a scandalous story of my own.
Waylon Smithers: Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet your new co-worker, Mindy Simmons. I think she has a degree in engineering or something.
Mindy: Hi. How's it goin'?
Lenny Leonard: (BORED) Pleased to meet ya.
Carl Carlson: Yeah, ditto.
Homer Simpson: (NOT LOOKING AT HER) Hi.
Cherub Lenny: Homer, what's the matter?
Cherub Carl: Ain't you ever seen a naked chick ridin' a clam before?
Homer Simpson: Gotta go.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - corridor)

Homer Simpson: That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator.
Homer Simpson: (SHUDDERS) That's unsexy.
Homer Simpson: Ew.
Homer Simpson: Well, this is my floor.
Homer Simpson: (DOPPLER) See you tomorrow....
Homer Simpson: I tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nuclear convention in Capital City together...
(Homer's Room: int. homer's room - continuous)
Bellhop: TV's there; bathroom's there; and there's your king sized bed for...
Homer Simpson: Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it.
Mindy: (DEVILISH) Homer, I got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation.
Mindy: No, Homer. Let's do it. Let's call room service!
Homer Simpson: (AROUSED) Oh!
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - Mr. burns' office - continuous)
Waylon Smithers: Someone is charging room service to the company, sir.

Mindy: This was a really nice night, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (SOURLY) Yeah, yeah.
Mindy: What's wrong?
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah. Like you don't know. (WHINY) We're gonna have sex.
Mindy: Oh... well, we don't have to.
Homer Simpson: Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
Mindy: Well, desserts aren't always right.
Homer Simpson: (SADLY) But they're so sweet.
Mindy: (INTERRUPTING) Homer, you know how I feel. So it-it's up to you. Look in your heart. I think you'll see what you want.
Homer Simpson: (À LA BARRY WHITE) Oh, baby.
Marge Simpson: This was a wonderful idea, Homie.
Bart Simpson: What happened to Mindy?
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED) Yes, what did happen to her?
Homer Simpson: She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
Marge Simpson: Good. Does anyone else have a love story?
Lisa Simpson: Yes, I do. And just like your love stories, it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal.
Lisa Simpson: It started appropriately enough with an innocent boy being embarrassed on Valentine's Day...
Ralph Wiggum: (SNIFFLES)
Lisa Simpson: Poor Ralph.
Lisa Simpson: (FRIENDLY) Here you go, Ralph.
Ralph Wiggum: (SHYLY) You choo choo choose me?
Lisa Simpson: It was an unusually warm February 14th, so the children walked home without jackets.
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. school - 3 p.m.)
Ralph Wiggum: Can I walk you home... valentine?
Lisa Simpson: Sure, I guess.
Ralph Wiggum: That valentine sure was funny.
Lisa Simpson: (GIGGLES) Glad you liked it.
Ralph Wiggum: (GIGGLING) It says, "choo choo choooose me," and there's a picture of a train.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah. Nice gag.
Ralph Wiggum: Uh. So... Do you like... stuff?
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - afternoon)
Ralph Wiggum: The doctor said I wouldn't have so many nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of there.
Lisa Simpson: (NERVOUS LAUGH) Well, here's my house.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph.
Lisa Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Oh, a Malibu Stacy Convertible! (READING CARD) "Look in the tunk." He must mean trunk.

Chief Wiggum: Send it this way, boy.
Ralph Wiggum: Whoops.
Lisa Simpson: Aw.
Chief Wiggum: Aw. Nothing gets chocolate out. See?
Krusty the Clown: Now, for my favorite part of the show: (SQUINTS AT CUE CARD) Whazzat say? Talk to the audience!? Oh, God, this is always death. All right.
Lisa Simpson: (TO SELF) Oh no. Please don't show me with Ralph.
Krusty the Clown: (TO RALPH) What's your name, son?

Lisa Simpson: (SMALL WHIMPER)
Krusty the Clown: And is this your girlfriend, Ralph? (WINKS)
Ralph Wiggum: Yes! I love Lisa Simpson and when I grow up I'm going to marry her.
Lisa Simpson: (EXPLODES) Noooo!!
Lisa Simpson: Now you listen to me -- I don't like you. I never liked you, and the only reason I gave you that stupid valentine is 'cause nobody else would!

Bart Simpson: Watch this, Lis. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half.
Bart Simpson: A-a-a-a-and, now.
Lisa Simpson: (MOAN)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, not all romances turn out that way. Bart, do you have a love story that doesn't end in heartbreak?
(Bart's Treehouse: int. treehouse - A LITTLE LATER)
Bart Simpson: Yes, I do. The only girl I ever loved invited me up to the treehouse. She had something very important to tell me.
Laura Powers: I'm so happy, I just had to tell someone. (BEAT) I have a boyfriend.
Laura Powers: (NONCHALANT) You won't be needing this.
Bart Simpson: (SAD MOAN)
Bart Simpson: Wait, that did end in heartbreak. Thanks for opening up old wounds, you ma.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - kitchen)
Marge Simpson: Well, as Jerry Lee Lewis would say: "There's a whole lotta frowning going on." (CHUCKLE TURNS INTO A GROAN)
Lisa Simpson: Mom, doesn't any love story have a happy ending?

Grampa Simpson: I'll be back in a jiffy.
Marge Simpson: That's not my mother.
Grampa Simpson: I'll be back in a jiffy.

Grampa Simpson: (SPUTTERS IMPOTENTLY) Don't sneak up on a...
C. Montgomery Burns: No need for the blown gasket, Charlie! I'll have her back in one piece.
Marge Simpson: But in the end, just when things looked worse, true love triumphed.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?
Jacqueline Bouvier: Oh, Monty! My favorite song. How did--
C. Montgomery Burns: (IRATE) I specifically requested no romantic music! What!
Grampa Simpson: Mrs. Bouvier! Mrs. Bouvier!

(SENIOR CITIZEN'S MINIBUS: int. senior citizen's minibus - a few minutes later)

Lisa Simpson: That seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation.
Marge Simpson: I give up. Did anybody learn anything about love tonight?
Bart Simpson: I learned it screws everybody up.
Marge Simpson: There's that side of it. But there's also... (FRUSTRATED NOISE) help me out here, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, Mom. I've decided to save my love for someone who is guaranteed not to reject me.
Lisa Simpson: (WISTFUL) Soon, Corey, soon.
Marge Simpson: (SAD) Well, kids, I tried. Maybe you're right.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Marge. Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe I'm no expert on the subject. But there was one time I got it right...
(Inspiration Point: ext. inspiration point - night)

Marge Simpson: Take me home, Artie.
(Road: ext. road - night)
Artie Ziff: Marge, I would appreciate it if you didn't tell anybody about my busy hands. Not so much for myself, but I am so respected it would damage the town to hear it. Good night.

Homer Simpson: Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
Homer Simpson: All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!

Homer Simpson: Who? Oh.
Marge Simpson: My prom date.
Homer Simpson: Marge, pour vous.
Marge Simpson: Why so glum?
Homer Simpson: I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go.
Lisa Simpson: Ah, your first kiss.
Homer Simpson: But not the last.
Marge Simpson: Mmmm, Homie...
Marge Simpson: See kids, that's what I meant by romance.

Scratchy: Yep. This week is the grand opening of Itchy and Scratchy Land. The violentest place on earth.
Itchy: And to celebrate, for this week only, we're cutting ticket prices in half.
Krusty the Clown: Kids, you heard the cartoon rat. If you haven't already run to your parents begging to go, do it now. You won't be missing anything funny. I'll just be sitting here reading this grown-up's newspaper. (KRUSTY LAUGH)
Krusty the Clown: Go now!
Lisa Simpson: Dad! Remember how you said that going to Itchy and Scratchy Land would be too damned expensive?
Homer Simpson: Oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. Look at this Bible I just got. Fifteen bucks! And talk about a preachy book! Everybody's a sinner except for this guy.
Bart Simpson: (PRESSING ONWARD) But now Itchy & Scratchy Land is cutting ticket prices in half. Can we go, Dad? Can we can we can we, take it, Lis.

Marge Simpson: It's shaped like a diner. (SELLING IT) And it's on this really tall pole.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - master bedroom - night)

Homer Simpson: (GASP) TV Town! Hammock Land!
Marge Simpson: Oooh. Recipe-related bumper cars.
Lisa Simpson: Yayyyy!
Marge Simpson: Now wait a minute. I'm not sure about this. Every time we've ever gone on vacation, I end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. You have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time.
Homer Simpson: Embarrassed? What are you talking about?

Bart Simpson: Do it, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Well, okay. If it's fun. Let's see...
Homer Simpson: I'll take eleven hundred dollars worth.
(Itchy & Scratchy Land: ext. Itchy & scratchy land)
Homer Simpson: (WHINY MOAN)
(Restaurant: ext. restaurant)
Lisa Simpson: Cool! / Neat-o! (ETC.)
Marge Simpson: Such a violent motif.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is actually beneficial for children.
Lisa Simpson: Ow!
Bart Simpson: Ow!
Marge Simpson: (CONCERNED MURMUR)
Marge Simpson: (TO GUARD) Oh, please. It was just a figure of speech.
Engineer: (LAUGHS) There's no need to murmur, ma'am. Here at Itchy and Scratchy Land, we're just as concerned about violence as you are. That's why we're always careful to show the consequences of deadly mayhem so that we may educate as well as horrify.
Marge Simpson: When do you show the consequences? On TV, that mouse pulled out that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe. But in the next scene, the cat was breathing comfortably.
Engineer: Just like in real life. (LONG BEAT) Hey look over there!
(Itchy & Scratchy Hotel Restaurant: Int. Itchy & scratchy hotel restaurant - a little later)

Bart Simpson: (IN AWE) Wow, this is so much like my dreams it's scary.
Lisa Simpson: Awww, look at that cute little baby axe.
Marge Simpson: It's cute, but I'm sure it's very sharp, and probably dirty.
Engineer: (PATRONIZING CHUCKLE) Dirty, maybe... dangerous, hardly. These are the latest state-of-the-art animatronic robots. They have sensors that ensure they only attack each other, never the guests.
Marge Simpson: See all that stuff in there, Homer? That's why your robot never worked.
Marge Simpson: This is just what I was hoping for. Spending the day together as a family.
Marge Simpson: Ah, you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals.
Homer Simpson: Parents Island?
Marge Simpson: Yuh-huh. I'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner. Are you kids gonna be alright?

Mother #1: No. Come along, Bort.
Man: Are you talking to me?
Mother #1: No. My son is also named Bort.
Lisa Simpson: Who are all these characters?
Bart Simpson: Well you're probably too young to remember the short-lived Itchy & Scratchy and Friends Hour. They had to come up with some friends. There's Disgruntled Goat, Uncle Ant, Klu Klux Clam...
Lisa Simpson: Oh yeah. They weren't very funny.
Bart Simpson: I don't know, Disgruntled Goat had his moments.
(Club: int. club)
Announcer: Welcome to T.G.I. McScratchy's, where it's constantly New Years Eve. Here we go again - three, two, one...

Lisa Simpson: I wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us?
Bart Simpson: Wanna get a snow cone?
Lisa Simpson: Okay.
Bart Simpson: So, Mr. Itchy. You think you're God's gift to women, do ya?
Lisa Simpson: Don't do it, Bart.

Marge Simpson: I'm so embarrassed. I wish there was a hole I could just crawl into and die.
Policeman: Okay, throw her in the hole.
Marge Simpson: Stay away from me, Homer!
Professor Jonathan Frink: You've got to listen to me. Elementary chaos theory tells us that all robots will eventually turn against their masters and run amok in an orgy of blood and kicking and the biting with the metal teeth and the hurting and shoving.
Scientist: How much time do we have, Professor?
Professor Jonathan Frink: Well according to my calculations, the robots won't go berserk for at least twenty-four hours.
Professor Jonathan Frink: Uh, I forgot to uh, carry the one. (FRINK NOISE)

Bart Simpson: (GASP) Sideshow Bob! (GROANS) I'm only ten and I already got two mortal enemies.
Bart Simpson: (OMINOUSLY) Hey, mouse! Say cheese. (THEN, TO HIMSELF) Hmm... with a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero.
Homer Simpson: Die, bad robots, die! (CHUCKLE) With a dry, cool wit like that (BART BEGINS SPEECH BELOW) I could be an action hero.
Bart Simpson: (POINTEDLY OVERLAPPING THE LAST SIX WORDS OF HOMER'S SPEECH) Who would've thought that our visit to Itchy and Scratchy Land would turn out to be our best vacation ever.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, best ever.
Marge Simpson: Are you two bonkers? We almost got killed, not to mention all the embarrassment I suffered.
Lisa Simpson: But Mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation. It brought us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors, and we have so many memories.
Marge Simpson: (BEAT) You know, you're right. This truly was the best vacation ever. (CURT) Now, let us never speak of it again.
(Itchy & Scratchy Land Entrance: ext. Itchy & scratchy land entrance)

Bart Simpson: But it would be funny to someone who was watching us.
Marge Simpson: (SKEPTICAL MURMUR)

Mayor Joe Quimby: Hey, I am no longer illiterate.
(KBBL: INT. KBBL - CONTINUOUS)
Birch Barlow: Now why are we doomed to this Quimby quagmire, you ask, o reasonable listener? Because this town is under the stranglehold of a few tie-dyed tree huggers who would rather play hackey-sack than lock up the homeless.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING)
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR) This sounds awfully controversial. Lisa, you know I don't like controversy in this house.

Lisa Simpson: (GASP) That sounds like Sideshow Bob!
Homer Simpson: Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob. Yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box.

Sideshow Bob: Well -- you see, Birch, I'm presently incarcerated.
(Springfield Prison: INT. SPRINGFIELD PRISON - PAY PHONE - CONTINUOUS)
Sideshow Bob: Convicted of a crime I didn't even commit. (DERISIVE SNORT) "Attempted" murder. Now, honestly, what is that? (SARCASTIC) Do they give a Nobel Prize for "Attempted" Chemistry? Do they --
Sideshow Bob: (COVERING PHONE, TO O.S.) Oh really, now! This is a personal call!

Sideshow Bob: He wants to sell your future short!

Sideshow Bob: (LONG DIABOLICAL LAUGH CONTINUES)
Sideshow Bob: So sorry, Mr. Simpson. Your house is blocking construction of our new Matlock Expressway.
Sideshow Bob: Now, I am a fair man. You will have seventy-two hours to vacate. At that time, we will blow up your house and any remaining Simpsons.
Marge Simpson: (EMOTIONAL) Homer, we've got to stop them.
Homer Simpson: I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigajer. And no one in my family's gonna stand for it!
Grampa Simpson: (YELLING DOWN) Move your god darned house, Son!
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING)
Seymour Skinner: Bart, by special request of the Mayor's office, you are going to be left back.
Bart Simpson: (MOAN) You mean I have to repeat the fourth grade?
Seymour Skinner: Well, yes... but, not for four or five years. Bart, you're going to kindergarten.
Bart Simpson: Kindergarten?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Ha!
Kindergarten Teacher: Now boys and girls, who knows what this is?
Bart Simpson: (RAISING HAND) Triangle.
Kindergarten Teacher: Very good, Bart. You have first choice of toys for free play.

(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT)
Homer Simpson: We're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls.
Lisa Simpson: I don't think Bob won that election legally. I can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted felon would get so few.
(HALL OF RECORDS: INT. HALL OF RECORDS - A FEW MINUTES LATER)
Clerk: Here you go. The results of last month's mayoral election. All forty-eight thousand voters and who each one of them voted for.

Lisa Simpson: Hey!
(PARKING STRUCTURE: EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT)
Bart Simpson: So whoever it is who wrote that note wants to meet us here tonight?
Lisa Simpson: This is so cool, Bart. We're just like Woodward and Bernstein!
Bart Simpson: Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading Archie comics.
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY MUTTER RE: COMIC) Stuck-up Riverdale punks. Think they're too good for me.
Shadowy Figure: (MUFFLED VOICE) You're on the right track. Follow the names.
Bart Simpson: How the hell do you know?
Shadowy Figure: (PUFFS CIGARETTE) I can't tell you who I am, but I worked on the campaign.
Homer Simpson: Hey, Mr. Smithers!
Waylon Smithers: (PEEVED) Well, you might as well give me a ride home now!
(Homer's Car: INT. HOMER'S CAR - A LITTLE LATER)
Waylon Smithers: I've never gone behind Mr. Burns' back before, but Sideshow Bob's ultra-conservative views conflict with my, choice of lifestyle.
Waylon Smithers: (CLEARS THROAT) All I can do is give you one name. Edgar Neubauer. Find him and you'll find your answer.
Lisa Simpson: (MOAN) No Edgar Neubauer.
(Street: EXT. STREET - A MINUTE LATER)
Lisa Simpson: This is hopeless. They're gonna demolish our house for sure. We're gonna have to move into a Motel 6.
Bart Simpson: But dad can't afford six dollars a night.
Bart Simpson: (NOTICES SOMETHING O.S.) Heyyy...
Bart Simpson: Lis! Lis! C'mere! I found him! I found Edgar Neubauer!
Bart Simpson: (GENUINELY SCARED) Oh my God! The dead have risen and they're voting Republican!
Lisa Simpson: (GASP) No, Bart, don't you see? Dead people can't vote!
Lisa Simpson: (GASP) Look! Prudence Goodwyfe, died 1641. (CHECKS LIST) She voted for Bob, too! (GASP) So did Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, and the Big Bopper!
(PET CEMETERY: EXT. PET CEMETERY - A MINUTE LATER)
Lisa Simpson: Even the pet cemetery voted for Bob! (GASP) Look! (RE: MONKEY GRAVE) Mr. and Mrs. Bananas! (RE: SNAKE GRAVE) Humphrey Boa-gart!

Lisa Simpson: All right, Bob! Now it's personal!!

(Springfield Town Hall: INT. CITY HALL - HEARING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY)
Lionel Hutz: Mr. Mayor, is it true you rigged the election?
Sideshow Bob: No, I did not.
Lionel Hutz: (AFTER A LONG UNCOMFORTABLE BEAT) Kids, help.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Ha!
Sideshow Bob: Oh, I don't mind. We want these children to feel justice has been served. That way, they can sleep soundly tonight on their hard, feculent motel pillows. (BEAT) Well, Bart, Lisa, here I am.
Lisa Simpson: (SOTTO TO BART) I have a plan. I think we can trap him.
Lisa Simpson: (VERY CASUAL) You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you when you say you're innocent...
Sideshow Bob: Indeed I am.
Lisa Simpson: Because we all know you're a naive pawn, puppet, if you will, (BUILDING) of the most diabolical political genius Springfield has ever known (POINTING) -- Birchibald T. Barlow!
Birch Barlow: (LIVID SPUTTERING)
Lisa Simpson: You don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you?
Bart Simpson: You were just Barlow's lackey!
Lisa Simpson: You were Ronnie to his Nancy!
Bart Simpson: Sonny to his Cher!
Lisa Simpson: Ringo to his rest of the Beatles!
Sideshow Bob: (EXPLODING) Enough! Lies, lies, lies! I did it! I did it all!
Spectators: (GASPS, HUSHED MURMURS)
Sideshow Bob: There! Is that what you want, you smarmy little bastards?!
Bart Simpson: We want the truth!
Sideshow Bob: You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! No truth-handler, you! Bah! I deride your truth-handling abilities!
Judge Snyder: Would you get to the point?
Sideshow Bob: Yes. Only I could have executed such a masterpiece of electoral fraud. And I have the records to prove it! Here, just look at these! Each one a work of Machiavellian art!
Judge Snyder: But why?
Sideshow Bob: (TURNING) Because you need me, Springfield! Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside, you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! That's why I did this -- to protect you from yourselves! (PAUSE) Now, if you don't mind, I have a city to run.
Judge Snyder: Bailiffs! Place the Mayor under arrest!
Sideshow Bob: What? (BEAT) Oh, yes. All that stuff I did...
Lisa Simpson: Bart! We did it! Now we get to keep our house, and you get to go back to fourth grade!
Groundskeeper Willie: (GASP) Boy, you read my thoughts! You've got the "shinning."
Bart Simpson: (DISMAYED) Aww. Tomorrow we were gonna find out who the dish ran away with.
Lisa Simpson: (A BIT ANNOYED) The spoon, Bart.
Bart Simpson: (EPIPHANY, GASP) Of course!

Marge Simpson: When you locked the front door, did you remember to lock the back door?
Homer Simpson: (TWO ANNOYED GRUNTS)
Lisa Simpson: (GASP) Oh no! We left Grampa back at the gas station.
Lisa Simpson: What about Grampa?

Waylon Smithers: Sir, they're the new winter caretakers for the lodge.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, they work hard and they play hard.
(RETREAT: Int. retreat - living room)
C. Montgomery Burns: This house has quite a long and colorful history. It was built on an ancient Indian burial ground, and was the setting of satanic rituals, witch burnings, and five John Denver Christmas Specials.
Homer Simpson: (SHUDDERS) John Denver.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmm, that's odd. Usually the blood gets off at the second floor.
Bart Simpson: Hey, I found a short cut through your hedgemaze.
Groundskeeper Willie: (SPUTTERS)
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE'S BRAIN: Now, now. Go easy on the wee one. His father's gonna go crazy and chop them all into haggis.
Bart Simpson: What's haggis?
Groundskeeper Willie: Shhh! You wanna' get sued? Now look, boy. If your Da' goes ga-ga, you just use that (EYES DARTING) "shin" of yours to call me and I'll come a-runnin'. But don't be readin' my mind between four and five. That's Willie's time.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, by cutting off cable TV and the beer supply, I can ensure an honest winter's work out of those low-lifes.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, did you ever stop to think that maybe it was doing this that caused the previous caretakers to go insane and murder their families?
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONSIDERING) Hmm, perhaps. (THEN) Tell you what. We come back and everyone's slaughtered, I owe you a coke.
(Caretakers Quarters: Int. caretakers quarters - continuous)

Homer Simpson: You don't look so happy.

Homer Simpson: (RE: CEILING) So, what do you think, Marge? All I need is a title. I was thinking along the lines of "No TV and No Beer Make Homer..." something something.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED) Go crazy?
Homer Simpson: Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat!

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: And now my daughter Jessica, who has just returned from boarding school, will read the same passage I just read. I noticed a few of you weren't paying attention.
Bart Simpson: (GROANS)
Bart Simpson: Wow, there is a God.
(SEASHORE: Ext. seashore - Foggy)
Engineer: I'm tellin' you, the light would work better if it pointed out to sea.
Captain Horatio McCallister: Arrr! Shut up, I know what I'm doin'.
Captain Horatio McCallister: I hate the sea and everything in it!
(First Church of Springfield: Ext. church - day)
Helen Lovejoy: Bye, b-bye, b-bye... Thank you for choosing our church... B-Bye...
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) I've never felt this way about a girl before. My long search is finally over.
Bart Simpson: (SINCERELY) Hi. I'm Bart Simpson. I was incredibly moved by your reading. I don't think God's words have ever sounded so plausible.
Jessica: (UNMOVED) Thanks, Art. Um, I have to go over here now.
Bart Simpson: (SAD SOUND)
(Lisa's Bedroom: int. Lisa's room - night)
Lisa Simpson: Don't be so hard on yourself, Bart. It's not your fault Jessica doesn't like you.
Bart Simpson: Is it my hair? My overbite? The fact that I've worn the same clothes, day in, day out, for the last four years?
Jessica: You're bad, Bart Simpson.
Lisa Simpson: No, Bart. I just think you and Jessica are too different from each other to get along. She's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter and you're the devil's cabana boy.
(Sunday School: ext. Sunday school - day)
Teacher: Good... very good... Ralph, Jesus did not have wheels.
Teacher: Bart Simpson?
Bart Simpson: Yes Ma'am. I'd like to return to your wonderful Sunday school, please.
Teacher: (GIGGLES NERVOUSLY; THEN) But Bart, we banned you from Sunday school. You were happy, we were happy, everybody was happy, particularly the hamster.
Bart Simpson: I've changed my ways. Please give me another chance, ma'am.
Teacher: (SWEETLY) All right, Bart, the Bible does teach forgiveness... (TO CLASS) Class, I want you to welcome back our prodigal son.
Class: Prodigal wha? / Who? / Huh? / What's prodigal mean?
Teacher: Oh dear.
Bart Simpson: You know, the great thing about Sunday school is we're finally learning something we can use.
Jessica: (UNIMPRESSED) Yeah, so true. I have to turn my chair this way now.
Bart Simpson: Somehow I gotta convince her I'm a good person. All right, I have to sit here and behave no matter what.
Teacher: Okay, class. We have a special treat today for pass-around -- a replica of the slingshot David used to slay Goliath... While you kids are looking at that, I'll just busy myself in this file cabinet.
Bart Simpson: Must... fight... Satan. Make it... up to him... later.
Bart Simpson: (RELIEVED SIGH) (LEANING TOWARD JESSICA) You know I was considering staying after school and helping teacher clean up.
Jessica: (YAWNING) Do you ever think anything you don't say?
Bart Simpson: There is just no pleasing a girl like that. All that unnecessary behaving... I'm all tensed through the chestal area. I need relief.
Groundskeeper Willie: Now that kilt was only for day-to-day wear. In battle we donned a full length ball gown covered in sequins. The idea was to blind your opponent with luxury.
Groundskeeper Willie: Ah, 'tis no more than what God gave me, you Puritan pukes!
Bart Simpson: (DUSTING HIS HANDS, EVIL CHUCKLE, CONTENTED SIGH) That'll hold me. At least 'til I get my hands on some kind of explosives.
Bart Simpson: (SURPRISED GASP)
Bart Simpson: No I'm not. I'm really...
Seymour Skinner: Congratulations, Simpson. You just fell for our sting and won yourself three months detention. There's no such thing as Scotchtoberfest.
Groundskeeper Willie: There's not? You used me Skinner! You used me!
Bart Simpson: Three months (MOANS).
Jessica: Hi, Bart. I saw the way they set you up. That was really unfair.
Bart Simpson: (DEPRESSED MURMUR)
Jessica: Wanna have dinner at my house tonight?
Bart Simpson: (SURPRISED) Really? Uh, sure.
Jessica: Great. We eat at seven.
Bart Simpson: There's only one thing to do at a moment like this... (VERY COCKY) strut.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - BATHROOM - DAY)
Homer Simpson: I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date. (SINGING SOULFULLY) SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET / CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS! (SNIFFLES)
Marge Simpson: Oh that's sweet, Homer. Our son is growing up, isn't he?
Homer Simpson: No, it's not that. Didn't you hear? They have no bananas. (BREAKING DOWN) They have no bananas today.
(LOVEJOY HOUSE: Int. Lovejoy house - dining room - night)
Helen Lovejoy: (CONDESCENDING) So Bart, how's school going? Jessica always gets straight A's.
Bart Simpson: Well, in my family, grades aren't that important. It's what you learn that counts.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (CHALLENGING) Six times five, what is it?
Bart Simpson: (BEAT; THEN) Um, actually, numbers don't have much use in my future career. (PROUDLY) Olympic gold medal rocket sled champ.
Helen Lovejoy: Hm, I didn't know the rocket sled was an Olympic event.
Bart Simpson: Well no offense, lady, but what you don't know could fill a warehouse.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Young man, explain yourself.
Bart Simpson: Sorry, I have kind of a short fuse, which some find charming. Speaking of charming, watching Fox last night, I heard a rather amusing story... This character named Martin was feeling rather randy and he was heard to remark...
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: And don't you ever come near my daughter again! Never have I heard such gratuitous use of the word "butt".
Bart Simpson: (TRYING TO EXPLAIN) But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...
Helen Lovejoy: (SCREAMING) Make him stop! Make him stop!
Bart Simpson: (RESIGNED) O-kay.
Jessica: Yes you are. You're bad, and I like it.
Bart Simpson: (BEAT) I'm bad to the bone, honey.
Jessica: Let's go find some fun.
Bart Simpson: But your father said...
Jessica: Oh, I told the "Rev" I was going to my room to say my prayers.
Bart Simpson: (STARRY EYED) Smart, beautiful, and a liar! (HAPPILY BEWILDERED) So much better than that Sarah, plain and tall.
(Street: Ext. street - night)
Bart Simpson: Right there, put it right there. (LAUGH) Oh, excellent. You're incredible, Jessica. Your throws, your catches, your spirals, your loops, it's like the toilet paper is an extension of your body.
(Springfield Elementary School Yard: Ext. schoolyard - day)
Milhouse Van Houten: No way would a minister's daughter go out with you.
Bart Simpson: Oh yeah? I'll prove it.
Bart Simpson: (CALLING) Hey, Jessica.
Jessica: (VERY UNFAMILIAR) Yes? Am I supposed to know you?
Bart Simpson: Jessica we just...
Nelson Muntz: That's for besmirching an innocent girl's name!
Bart Simpson: Why?
Jessica: I'm sorry, Bart -- you know my parents can't find out about us. And besides, if it's secret, it's even more exciting.
Bart Simpson: (RUBBING STOMACH) I guess.
Jessica: Hey, you want to go skateboarding?
Bart Simpson: (STILL HOLDING HIS STOMACH) Um, actually, I was hoping I could sit down for just a second.
Jessica: Come on, it'll be fun.
Bart Simpson: Wow. Now I have the energy to do anything!
Bart Simpson: (MOANS) Just give me two minutes.
Jessica: (FRUSTRATED NOISE)
(WINDY HILLTOP: Ext. windy hilltop)
Bart Simpson: Jessica, I think this is too steep.
Jessica: Bart, you can't trust your perception at this altitude.
Bart Simpson: (HOPEFUL) Actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity, I just might be able to hold on.
Bart Simpson: (RELIEVED SIGH)
Bart Simpson: (RELIEVED SIGH)
Bart Simpson: Oh, the glue will slow me down.
Trucker #1: Any glue leaking?
Trucker #2: No. That glue ain't goin' nowhere.
Bart Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED GROAN) Nothin's ever gonna stop me.
Trucker #1: Ah, no. There goes the glue, after all!
Bart Simpson: Nooooo!
Jessica: Fun, huh?
Bart Simpson: (GURGLING SOUND)
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - kitchen - morning)
Marge Simpson: Have you noticed any change in Bart?
Homer Simpson: New glasses?
Marge Simpson: No. He looks like something might be disturbing him.
Homer Simpson: Probably misses his old glasses.
Marge Simpson: I guess we could get more involved in Bart's activities. But then I'd be afraid of smothering him.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, and then we'd get the chair.
Marge Simpson: That's not what I meant.
Homer Simpson: It was, Marge. Admit it.
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. school - day)
Jessica: Hi.
Bart Simpson: Uh, we should get to class.
Jessica: What's the hurry?
Bart Simpson: We could get in trouble for being late.
Jessica: Ah, you worry too much. Now come on, if you stay here awhile, I'll let you hold my hand.
Jessica: Team work! C'mon Bart!
Groundskeeper Willie: If I don't sae the wee turtles, who will?!
Groundskeeper Willie: Agh! Save me from the wee turtles! They were too quick for me! Aah!
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - living Room - day)
Lisa Simpson: I can't believe it, Bart. I'd always thought Jessica was so sweet.
Bart Simpson: She's like a Milk Dud, Lis. Sweet on the outside, poison on the inside.
Lisa Simpson: You gotta give her up.
Bart Simpson: No, no, wait. Hear my plan. I put up with her for seven more years. Then, we'll get married. Once the first baby comes along, she's bound to settle down and start treatin' me right. After all, I deserve it.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, it's naive to think you can change a person. (WISTFULLY) Except maybe that boy who works in the library.
Ralph Wiggum: Do you have Go Dog Go?
Library Boy: (DISMISSIVE SNORT) That's in juvenile. This is young adult.
Lisa Simpson: Well read and just a little wild. (WORSHIPFUL SIGH) If only someone could tame him.
Bart Simpson: You're right, Lisa -- love isn't about fixing someone. I'm just going to give her up cold turkey. I'm not gonna talk to her or see her. It's over. Thanks for the advice, sis.
Lisa Simpson: (DISTRACTED DREAMY SOUND)
Bart Simpson: There. If I can just get through this many days without seeing her, she should be completely out of my system. Okay, day one.
Marge Simpson: Time for church, Bart. I bet your little friend Jessica will be there.
Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(First Church of Springfield: Ext. church - day)
Bart Simpson: Jessica...
Lisa Simpson: Bart, be strong. You don't need that little hell cat.
Bart Simpson: Oh Lis, she's already drawing me to her with her beautiful siren song.
Bart Simpson: (SHUDDERS) That's very disturbing.
Jessica: Hey, Bart. (OFF HIS REACTION, A LITTLE HURT) What? What's wrong?
Bart Simpson: Well, Jessica, I don't think we should hang out together anymore. You're turning me into a criminal when all I want to be is a petty thug.
Homer Simpson: Oh good, here comes the collection plate.
Marge Simpson: (READING) Thirty cents off Shake 'n Bake. (ADMONISHING) Homer!
Homer Simpson: We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed.
Jessica: You're right about everything, Bart. I have been too reckless. From now on I am going to settle down.
Bart Simpson: (PANICKED) Jessica, what are you doing!
Jessica: It takes money to start a new life.
Bart Simpson: But stealing from the collection basket is really wrong. Even I know that.
Jessica: Oh, fine. You just lost your cut.
Helen Lovejoy: I'll just take that (SEES IT'S EMPTY, GASPS). Everyone, turn around and look at this!
Grampa Simpson: What is it, a Unitarian?
Various Congregation Members: (AD-LIBBING) The collection money is gone! / That awful boy must have stolen it!
Bart Simpson: I...
Helen Lovejoy: (CUTTING HIM OFF) Took the money. Yes, we know.
Moe Szyslak: He confessed!
Homer Simpson: Stop him! He's headed for the window!
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - night)
Homer Simpson: Son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money, that's all I need.
Bart Simpson: (LOOKING HIM IN THE EYE) I didn't take it.
Homer Simpson: Why you little... How can you look me in the eye and lie like that?!
Marge Simpson: Homer, stop that. I believe him.
Homer Simpson: Tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?
Marge Simpson: That's what he wore to church.
Homer Simpson: Ooo, how convenient.
Marge Simpson: Bart honey, do you know who did take the money?
Bart Simpson: (LONG, AGONIZING BEAT) No.
Homer Simpson: See, son? Telling the truth isn't so bad.
(Springfield: Ext. Springfield - day)
Car: Crook!
Car: Thief!
Car #3: (DOPPLER FADE OUT) Stealer of money from the church collection plate!
(LOVEJOY HOUSE: Ext. Lovejoy house - day)
Bart Simpson: We've gotta talk.
Jessica: Listen, thanks for not turning me in. That was sweet.
Bart Simpson: Well, it seems like if you really care for me, you should come forward.
Jessica: Oh, don't you see? It's because I care for you that I can't come forward.
Bart Simpson: (BEAT) That doesn't make any sense.
Jessica: All right, then I just don't feel like it, okay?
Bart Simpson: Jessica, you're really beautiful, but you are not very nice.
Jessica: Duh.
Bart Simpson: You know, with the way you're treating me, why should I protect you?
Jessica: Because if you tell, no one will believe you. Remember, I'm the sweet, perfect minister's daughter and you're just yellow trash.
Bart Simpson: (YOKEL SOUND) Huh?
(Bart's Treehouse: int. Bart's treehouse - later)
Lisa Simpson: So here's where you're hiding.
Bart Simpson: Yeah. This is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople.
Jasper Beardly: Thief.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, we can't just let her get away with this.
Ralph Wiggum: I won! I won!
Bart Simpson: Give it up, Lis. She's a criminal mastermind. She's got a 108 IQ, she reads at a fifth grade level, and (DREAMILY) her hair smells like red Fruit Loops.
Lisa Simpson: (DETERMINED) Yeah, well I eat Fruit Loops for breakfast.
(First Church of Springfield: int. church - day)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Because of last week's problems, we'll be taking certain precautions with this week's collection.
Marge Simpson: We really shouldn't have let them do this. It can't be helping his self esteem.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now, for our offertory reading, Lisa Simpson, who we'll all be keeping an eye on.
Lisa Simpson: I know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof. But doesn't the Bible teach us "Judge not lest ye be judged," Reverend?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (GRUDGINGLY) I think it might be somewhere towards the back.
Lisa Simpson: There is someone among us with a guilty conscience. After much soul searching I decided it would be wrong of me to name names, but I urge that guilty person here, under the eyes of God, to come forward to confess and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell.
Seymour Skinner: I smelled some marijuana smoke in Vietnam.
Grampa Simpson: I was the one that canceled "Star Trek".
Dr. Julius Hibbert: I left my Porsche keys inside Mrs. Glick.
Lisa Simpson: I am talking to the collection money thief. Only you can come forward and end this injustice.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, what the heck, it was Jessica Lovejoy.
Congregation: (GASP)
Lisa Simpson: If you search her room, I am certain you will find the money.
Homer Simpson: To the little girl's room!
(LOVEJOY HOUSE: Int. Lovejoy house - Jessica's bedroom - day)
Seymour Skinner: That's the collection money!
Moe Szyslak: Ah, yeah, it smells like church.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I guess it's obvious what's happened here. Bart Simpson has somehow managed to sneak his bedroom into my house.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well come on! Use your imaginations.
Jessica: No, Dad, I did it. It's your classic cry for attention.
Seymour Skinner: (CALLING OUT) All right, first academic alert: Wiggum, Ralph...
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, young lady, I suppose we brought you home from boarding school a little prematurely.
Jessica: I was expelled, Dad. Remember the pipe bomb? The glee club brawl? Remember the school chapel collection plate? The exploding toilets ring a bell? Come on dad, pay attention to me. Hello in there... hello?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (SINGING) BRINGING IN THE SHEAVES... BRINGING IN THE SHEAVES
Marge Simpson: Uh, I think you all owe my son an apology.
Bart Simpson: That's okay. 'Preciate it... Mm Hmm.
(Street: Ext. street - day)
Bart Simpson: Hi, Jessica.
Jessica: Hi Bart, come to watch me suffer?
Bart Simpson: I just wanted to let you know that even though this was a difficult experience, I really learned a lot... I'm a little wiser and a little less naïve.
Jessica: Well, I learned that I can make men do whatever I want.
Bart Simpson: Well, don't you see, Jessica, then you really haven't learned --
Jessica: (INTERRUPTING) Um, would you finish scrubbing these steps for me?
Bart Simpson: (STARRY EYED) Will I!
Library Boy: Hey, Jessica.
Jessica: Coming.
Bart Simpson: Poor sucker. It's amazing what some guys will do for a pretty face. Not me though. Wait'll she sees the second rate job I do on these stairs. (SNEAKY CHUCKLE).

Kent Brockman: (QUICK, GUTTURAL BARK) Hello-I'm-Kent Brockman!
Kent Brockman: Our top stories tonight, a tremendous explosion... in the price of lumber. And "President Reagan dyes... his hair," says Garry Trudeau in his new musical comedy revue. But first, let's check the death count from the killer storm bearing down on us like a shotgun full of snow.
Weatherman: Well Kent, as of now the death count is zero, but it is ready to shoot right up.
Kent Brockman: (VERY UPSET) Oh my God! Damn you, snow!
Bart Simpson: All right, snow day! No school tomorrow!
Reporter: What a story!
Lisa Simpson: That doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report. What if the weatherman is wrong?
Bart Simpson: Lisa, that man is a professional meteorologist.
Weatherman: Kent, I'd like to remind everybody to come down and watch me at the Springfield Laugh 'n Brew 'n Burgers 'n Fries this Saturday. The forecast calls for a seventy-five percent chance of hilarity.
Homer Simpson: I like those odds.
(Bart's Bedroom: int. bart's bedroom - the next morning)

Jimbo Jones: (TEASING) Nice p.j.'s, Simpson! Did your Mommy buy them for you?
Bart Simpson: Of course she did. Who else would have?
Jimbo Jones: (BEAT) All right Simpson, you win this round.
(Bart's Classroom: int. bart's classroom - an hour later)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Okay, it's book report time! We'll do them alphabetically. Today it's "A" through "M."
Bart Simpson: (TO SELF) I'm saved! I love being a S-s-s-simpson!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Let's see, we have no "A's," so let's go right to the "B's." Bart?
Bart Simpson: (SHOCKED) Huh?!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Ha!!
Bart Simpson: (SLOWLY) Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't...
Seymour Skinner: Attention. This is Principal Skinner, your principal, with a message from the principal's office. All students please proceed immediately to an assembly in the Butthead Memorial Auditorium. (TO HIMSELF) Dammit I wish we hadn't let the students name that one.
(Springfield Elementary School Auditorium: int. school auditorium - a few minutes later)
Seymour Skinner: Children, the times, they are a-becoming quite different. Test scores are at an all time low. So I've come up with these "Academic Alerts." (HOLDS UP A STACK OF RED CARDS) You will receive one as soon as your grades start to slip in any subject. This way, your parents won't have to wait until report card time to punish you.
Martin Prince: How innovative! I like it!
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Hey, Dolph, take a memo on your Newton: Beat up Martin.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Bah.
Seymour Skinner: No, no Ralph. This means you're failing English.
Ralph Wiggum: Me fail English? That's unpossible.
Seymour Skinner: Muntz, Nelson. You're failing history, geography, and math. But ah, you're doing quite well in Home-Ec.
Nelson Muntz: Hey, keep it down, man. (NERVOUS) Ha ha.
Seymour Skinner: Simpson...Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: (TO SELF) Grades are all I have. What could I be failing? I'm smart and a teacher's pet.
Lisa Simpson: (READING CARD) Gym?!! That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
Lisa Simpson: (HUMILIATED SOUND)
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - later that day)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about this warning. I really hope you try harder.
Homer Simpson: Whew, that's all of 'em. (PROUDLY) And I'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. How 'bout a present, son?
Bart Simpson: Well, I could use a new pair of hockey skates.
Homer Simpson: Done and done.
Lisa Simpson: That's not fair... Why is Bart getting a present and I'm getting chewed out?
Homer Simpson: Ah, the mysteries of life.
(GYM TEACHER'S OFFICE: int. gym teacher's office - the next day)
Gym Teacher: Tell you what, Simpson. I won't fail you if you join one of those Pee Wee teams outside the school.
Lisa Simpson: You mean those leagues where parents push their kids into vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory?
Gym Teacher: (ROLLS HER EYES) Look, I don't need this. I inhaled my favorite whistle this morning.

Homer Simpson: (SINGING) Sports, sports, sports, sports. Sports, sports, sports, sports. Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports.
Homer Simpson: (HALTING NOISE) I mean my little girl buddy.
Marge Simpson: (WHISPERING) I think Lisa needs to feel a little special tonight. How about letting her ride up front, too?

Chief Wiggum: Oh yes, we won! We won! We won! Um, unfortunately, since I bet on the other team, ah, we won't be going for pizza.
Homer Simpson: Well boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. Here's your turtle, alive and well.
Bart Simpson: Aw thanks, Dad.
Bart Simpson: How about some adulation from my li'l sister?
Lisa Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Wow Bart, I'm so impressed you were able to give Milhouse a concussion.
Bart Simpson: Ah, you're just jealous...
Bart Simpson: Because - you - stink - at - sports...
Lisa Simpson: (LITTLE SCREAMS) Cut it out, Bart!

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (ENTHUSIASTIC) Yeah, that's it, Milhouse! Keep up the chatter!
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson KITCHEN - that evening)
Homer Simpson: Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Oh! Ooh my - oh, the hell with it.
(Lisa's Bedroom: int. lisa's bedroom - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Well, I think women should be able to play any sport men play, but hockey is so violent and dangerous. Look at Milhouse's teeth.
Bart Simpson: Mom, will you stop showin' us those?
Lisa Simpson: I have to join the team, or I'll get an "F" that will haunt me for the rest of my life.
(THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL: Ext. the steps of the capitol - 2040)

Everyone: (GASPS)
Justice: In that case, I sentence you to a lifetime of horror on Monster Island. (COMFORTING) Don't worry -- it's just a name.
(MONSTER ISLAND: ext. Monster island)

Homer Simpson: We're laughing with her, Marge! There's a big difference.
Lisa Simpson: (SCREAMS)
Homer Simpson: (TO MARGE) With her.
Lisa Simpson: You really think I did okay out there, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Absolutely, honey. By blocking the net I really think you helped your team.
Homer Simpson: Okay, little buddy, hop in!
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Lisa Simpson: That's very nice, Dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. However, I will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love.
Homer Simpson: Okay, hon.
Homer Simpson: Sucker. Competitive, violent, that's why you're here.
(Apu's Apartment: int. apu's apartment - later)

Lisa Simpson: Don't worry, Bart, they won't bother you anymore.

(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpsons' kitchen)
Bart Simpson: Come watch TV with me, Dad. We missed the first two episodes of Cops, but if we hurry we can catch the last three.

Marge Simpson: Bart, I can spend some time with you.
Bart Simpson: I dunno, Mom.
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson's living room - the next morning)

Marge Simpson: Lemme give my special little winner a big, big hug.
Lisa Simpson: Ma. I think I'm all hugged out. Oh... one more.
Bart Simpson: Hello, queen Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: (STARTLED GASP) Bart, what are you doing in my room?
Bart Simpson: Lisa, certain differences, rivalries, if you will, have come up between us. At first I thought we can talk it over like civilized people. But instead, (EVIL) I just ripped the head off Mr. Honeybunny.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, that was your cherished childhood toy.
Bart Simpson: (PANICKED) Mr. Honeybunny!
Homer Simpson: Quiet down, Bart!
Lisa Simpson: Bart, just get out of here.
Bart Simpson: Hey! It's a free country. You get out.
Lisa Simpson: That doesn't make sense.
Bart Simpson: I know you are, but what am I?
Lisa Simpson: Get out! Get out!
Bart Simpson: Okay, but on my way, I'm gonna be doing this.
Bart Simpson: If you get hit, it's your own fault.
Lisa Simpson: Okay. Then I'm going to start kicking air like this. And if any part of you should fill that air, it's your own fault.
(KITCHEN: int. kitchen - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Hm, I better go check that out. Now Homer, don't you eat this pie.
Homer Simpson: Okay. (TO PIE) All right, pie, I'm just gonna do this.
Homer Simpson: And if you get eaten, it's your own fault.
Farmer: 'Round back... oops.
Marge Simpson: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Bart Simpson: Mom, that is really annoying.
Lisa Simpson: Bart started it.
Bart Simpson: Uh uh, Lisa started it.
Marge Simpson: I don't care who started it. I don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. We love you both. You're not in competition with each other. Repeat. You are not in competition with each other.
Homer Simpson: Hey! Apu just called. This Friday Lisa's team is playing Bart's team. You're in direct competition. And don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. I want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.
Homer Simpson: Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
(Springfield Prison: int. Springfield prison)
Chief Wiggum: All right, I'm going to make a little deal with you mugs. I'm gonna let you all out to see my team play the hockey game if you promise to return to your cells.
Snake Jailbird: Sorry, pig, we can't make that promise.
Chief Wiggum: All right. All right, I'll sweeten the deal. You can see the game, you don't have to come back, but you have to promise not to commit any more crimes, okay?
Snake Jailbird: No.
Chief Wiggum: I'll take that as a yes.

Marge Simpson: I won't have any aggressive condiment passing in this house.
Moe Szyslak: Hello.
Homer Simpson: Moe, what are you doin' here?
Moe Szyslak: What? What? A bartender can't come by and say "hi" to his best customer? (TO MARGE) Hey, hey there, Midge! Oh gee I like what you done to your hair.
Bart Simpson: You go, Mom. For the greater good.
Marge Simpson: You caught me at a real bad time, Moe. I hope you understand I'm too tense to pretend I like you.
Moe Szyslak: And how are the little kids doin'? I mean really how are they doin'. Any disabling injuries? Something, say, that the gambling community might not yet know about? (TO BART) Come here, let me see those knees.
Marge Simpson: Moe, I think you should leave.
Moe Szyslak: But Blanche! You gotta help me out here. Please! I'm sixty-four grand in the hole. They're gonna take my thumbs!
(SKATING RINK: ext. skating rink)

Bart Simpson: (UPSET) Mr. Honeybunny! You inhuman monster!
Lisa Simpson: You want a piece of me?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Stop it! Stop it! Conserve your precious hatred for the game.
Homer Simpson: Now that we're all alone, Marge, admit it. You like Lisa best.
Marge Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you?
Marge Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Well, you can't possibly like Maggie best. What has she ever done? Nothin' for nobody!
Marge Simpson: Homer, we can't root for one child over the other. You wouldn't like it if the kids played favorites with us.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Mom! Look at me, Mom!
Lisa Simpson: Hi Mom! Over here! Mom!
Homer Simpson: (CHEERFULLY) Hi kids!

Marge Simpson: He tripped my boy. I demand vengeance! I want vengeance!
Hockey Announcer: Jimbo Jones called for tripping. A penalty shot will be taken by Bart Simpson.
Lisa Simpson: (SOLEMNLY) For the greater good.
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpsons' living room - afternoon)
Homer Simpson: Oh my God, Marge. A penalty shot, with only four seconds left. It's your child versus mine! The winner will be showered with praise, the loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore.
Chief Wiggum: Kill 'er, boy! Kill 'er!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Stop 'em dead, little girl!
Crowd: Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart!
Crowd: Kill Bart! Kill Bart! Kill Bart!
Bart Simpson: Great game, Lis.

(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpsons' kitchen)
Bart Simpson: (DISGUSTED) Damn FDA. Why can't it all be marshmallow?
Lisa Simpson: Ew. Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. They go in the trash.
Homer Simpson: You like sweets, kids? (HAS A SECRET) I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. You'd spit them out! You would! I'm talking about the Candy Industry Trade Show. (WAVING TWO BRIGHTLY COLORED TICKETS).
Lisa Simpson: How did you get tickets?
Homer Simpson: They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump bar and Krusty Klump bar with almonds.

Lisa Simpson: No,me!Takeme!Me!Me!Me!
Homer Simpson: Sorry kids, but this is one event I want my darling wife by my side.
Marge Simpson: (PLEASED) Oh, well thank you Homer. But take one of the kids.
Homer Simpson: (WHINY) Ma-arge. They can't carry enough candy. (PINCHING LISA'S ARM) They have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you.
Marge Simpson: Homer, are all these pockets necessary?
Homer Simpson: They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
Marge Simpson: Well, that's the babysitter. (TO BART AND LISA) No one in town will sit for you two anymore. I had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scary-looking hobo.
Bart Simpson: (GOING TO ANSWER THE DOOR) Please the hobo. Please the hobo. Please the hobo.
Ashley: Hi, I'm Ashley Grant.
Bart Simpson: (GROANS)
Lisa Simpson: Ashley Grant! You gave a talk on women's issues at my school on how we don't have to be second class citizens.
Bart Simpson: (PANICKED) Mom! How can you leave us with this maniac?!
Homer Simpson: Hurry, Marge. If we get there early we can get our pictures taken with the two surviving Musketeers.
Marge Simpson: (BEING PULLED OUT THE DOOR) Well there's also a baby somewhere upstairs!
Bart Simpson: So, you're one of those "don't call me a chick" chicks, huh?
Lisa Simpson: Eh, sorry about my unenlightened brother. He will make the next few hours a living hell.
Ashley: Oh, I don't know. See this, Bart?
Bart Simpson: (EYES FOLLOWING IT AS IF ENTRANCED) Disemboweler 4, the game where condemned criminals dig at each other with rusty hooks.
Ashley: Mmm hmm. Do a little housework, and you can play for five minutes.
Bart Simpson: No waaaay. (STRUGGLING LIKE CAPTAIN KIRK FIGHTING A MIND RAY) Gg-aah... Yes'm.
Ashley: See, Lisa? Males aren't hard to tame. They all follow their video cartridges.

Homer Simpson: (GASP) I feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL, TO SALESPEOPLE) Brilliant... exquisite ...ooh, you'll do well... Gimme those, etc.
Professor Jonathan Frink: As you can see, I have created a lemonball so sour it can only be safely contained in a magnetic field. (TURNS TO EMPTY FORCE FIELD) The candy, known as 77X42 -- (SURPRISED NOISE) Where the hell is the candy?
Homer Simpson: I don't know.
Salesman: Hey sir, try our wax lips. It's the candy of a thousand uses.
Salesman: One, a humorous substitute for your own lips.
Homer Simpson: Mmm hmm. Keep going.
Salesman: Two, ah... ooh, I'm needed in the basement.
Security Guard: Ah, you're gonna have to put some sugar on that celery or get out, ma'am.
Homer Simpson: Oooh -- gummy bears. Gummy calves heads. Gummy jaw breakers.
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) What dat?
German Gummy Salesman: (GERMAN ACCENT) That is the rarest gummy of them all. The gummy Venus de Milo. Carved by gummy artisans who work exclusively in the medium of gummy.
Marge Simpson: Will you two stop saying "gummy" so much.
Homer Simpson: Must have rare gummy. (WHISPERING TO MARGE) Distract the salesman Marge!
Marge Simpson: No. I won't make a spectacle out of myself any further.
Marge Simpson: (TO CROWD) Oooh... how'd they get there? (WEAK LAUGH)
Homer Simpson: Now, this is going to take all my skill. (CHUCKLE)
German Gummy Salesman: Halt! Halt!
Homer Simpson: Run, Marge! Save the booty!
Homer Simpson: See you in hell, candy boys.

Lisa Simpson: I'm coming!
Marge Simpson: (GIGGLES)
Maggie Simpson: Wheee!
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where's my gummy de Milo? Okay, don't panic. She can't have gotten far; she has no arms.
Marge Simpson: I'm sure it'll turn up. Take the baby-sitter home now. She's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
Homer Simpson: Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in there.
Homer Simpson: See, she's having the time of her life.
(Simpson Car: int. simpsons' car - night)
Homer Simpson: So, a graduate student, huh? How come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?
Ashley: (CONFUSED) I'm sorry?
Homer Simpson: Nobody's blaming you. (BEAT) Hey, could you take the wheel for a second? I have to scratch myself in two places at once.
Ashley: (CREEPED OUT) Just drop me off here.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS, THEN UNDER HIS BREATH) Precious Venus...
Homer Simpson: (GURGLES HUNGRILY)
Homer Simpson: Hey, kids. Lots of candy left for breakfast.
Lisa Simpson: (PAINFULLY FULL GROAN)
Marge Simpson: Well why don't we give it to some needy children, then?
Lisa Simpson: (GREEDY "NO WAY" MOAN)
Homer Simpson: Oh no! The candy conventioneers tracked us down!

(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson House)
Protesters: (CHANTING) Two four six eight / Homer's crime was very great! (PAUSE) "Great" meaning "large or immense" / We used it in the pejorative sense!
Homer Simpson: Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am. I can't even say the word "titmouse" without giggling like a schoolgirl. (SCHOOLGIRL TITTER)
Marge Simpson: At any rate, I believe you and I think you should go outside and straighten this out. Some of their chants are very catchy and memorable.
Ashley: You grabbed me in the car!
Homer Simpson: Oh that. No. I was just grabbing a gummy Venus de Milo that got stuck to your pants.
Heavy Woman: Yeah right! That's the oldest excuse in the book.
Protesters: Boo!
Homer Simpson: C'mon, I'm a decent guy...
(Simpson Home: int. simpsons house - continuous)
Bart Simpson: Why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt? That's where cooties come from.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I don't understand. What is she saying you did?
Homer Simpson: Well Lisa, remember that post card Grampa sent us from Florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHING) Oh, yeah. That was brilliant.
Homer Simpson: That's right, we all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman.
Bart Simpson: And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal, Dad?
Homer Simpson: Well, that's kind of a gray area.
Bart Simpson: We know you're innocent, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Thanks, kids.

Marge Simpson: Homer--
Homer Simpson: (TOO EAGER) Uh-huh?
Marge Simpson: I already talked to the Indignation Coordinator out on the lawn today. I told her you were a decent man. But she wouldn't listen. Besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more I can do.
Homer Simpson: You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. (BUILDING PANIC) Oh no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, God help me! Help me, God!
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY EXPECTANT, EYES DARTING) Y'ello?
Deep Voice: Hello, Homer. This is God...frey Jones from the TV magazine show, Rock Bottom.

(Rock Bottom Studio: int. ROCK BOTTOM studio)
Homer Simpson: ...Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed, she was sitting on the gummy Venus so I grabbed it off of her. Oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy. (DROOLS) I just wish I had another one right now. But the most important thing is...

Godfrey: So, Mr. Simpson, you admit you grabbed her "can". What do you have to say in your defense?
Godfrey: Mr. Simpson, your silence will only incriminate you further.
Godfrey: No, Mr. Simpson, don't take your anger out on me! Get back! Get back!
Godfrey: Mr. Simpson, nooooo!
ROCK BOTTOM ANNOUNCER: (LOW, QUICK) Dramatization. May not have happened.

Fox Announcer: And now, we return to Fox Night at the Movies. "Homer S.: Portrait of An Ass Grabber," starring Dennis Franz.
Homer Simpson: (GRASPING AT STRAWS) Ooh, "Portrait!" Sounds classy... (WEAKLY) doesn't it?
Young Babysitter: No, Mr. Simpson! A cat is a living creature!
Dennis Franz: (SLURRING) I don't care!
Dennis Franz: Now, I'm gonna grab me sumpin' sweet!
Young Babysitter: No, Mr. Simpson. That's sexual harassment. If you keep it up, I'll yell so loud the whole country'll hear.
Dennis Franz: With a man in the White House? Not likely. (EVIL LAUGH)
Kent Brockman: This is hour fifty-seven of our live, round-the-clock coverage outside the Simpson estate. Remember, by the way, to tune in tonight at eight o'clock for highlights of today's vigil, including when the garbage man came, and when Marge Simpson put the cat out. Possibly because it was harassed, we don't know. (MORE)
Kent Brockman: Of course, there's no way to see into the Simpson home without some kind of infrared heat-sensitive camera. So let's turn it on.
Kent Brockman: Now this technology is new to me, but I'm pretty sure that's Homer Simpson in the oven, rotating slowly. His body temperature has risen to over four hundred degrees. He's literally stewing in his own juices. Now here are some results from our phone-in poll: 95 percent of the people believe Homer Simpson is guilty. Of course, this is just a television poll, which is not legally binding. Unless Proposition 304 passes, and we all pray it will.
Homer Simpson: (SADLY) I don't have a friend in the world.

(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house)
Homer Simpson: (MOAN) I need a hug.
Homer Simpson: How come you guys hesitated?
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, Dad. We do believe in you. We really do.

Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.
Homer Simpson: Are you hugging the TV?
Lisa Simpson: (GUILTILY) No. (BEAT, THEN THEY KISS THE TV)

Bumblebee Man: Ai yi yi! Es Homer Simpson. Me ha molestado. Ohh!

Standup: See I think about weird stuff. Like what would happen if E.T. and Mr. T. had a baby? Well, you'd get Mr. E.T. wouldn't ya? And you know I think he'd sound a little something like this: (COMBO MR. T AND E.T. VOICE) I pity the fool who doesn't phone home.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Oh, I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now.
Marge Simpson: Homer! Homie! The kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name!
Lisa Simpson: The media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. All they care about is entertainment. Well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word "entertainment" -- Public Access Television.
Homer Simpson: (GROANS) But those shows all look so crummy.

Homer Simpson: Hello. I am Homer Simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, "Father Goose." You know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. Nobody cares that I didn't do it. But I didn't. Okay, look, I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. Like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. So I figured, "We'll see about that." So I get this big chunk of cinderblock and I...
Homer Simpson: Oh, gotta go. Innocent!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, you did it! I am so proud of you.

Groundskeeper Willie: Homer, I love amateur video and your show is the most amateur video I ever saw.

Bart Simpson: Can I sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a U.F.O. does come?
Marge Simpson: We need to talk about the... marital difficulties we've been having lately.
Homer Simpson: (SAD) Marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but I promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex.

Homer Simpson: They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
(Bart's Treehouse: INT. BART'S TREEHOUSE - 6:00 P.M.)
Bart Simpson: Okay. It's now painfully clear. The adults are definitely paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people.
Milhouse Van Houten: You fool! Can't you see it's a massive government conspiracy? (TURNING SUSPICIOUS) Or have they gotten to you, too?
Lisa Simpson: Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it! Why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions? Haven't you heard of Occam's Razor? "The simplest explanation is probably the correct one."
Bart Simpson: So what's the simplest explanation?
Lisa Simpson: I don't know. (SARCASTIC) Maybe they're all reverse vampires, and they have to get home before dark.
Kids: Reverse vampires! / Etc.

Reporters: (APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES)
Mona Simpson: Oh, Abe, maybe our Homer could grow up to be president some day!

Grampa Simpson: Quitcher daydreamin', melonhead.
Homer Simpson: (A BIT SAD) Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? Maybe I could've been something more than I am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm.
(Farmhouse: EXt. farmhouse - continuous)
Grampa Simpson: Who are you to complain? You lock me up in a home and give me the same damn shower safety seat every Christmas!
(Marge's Station Wagon: INT. STATION WAGON - COUNTRY ROAD - MINUTES LATER)
Homer Simpson: Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me.
Grampa Simpson: That's 'cause you're a screw-up.
Homer Simpson: You're the screw-up!
Grampa Simpson: Why you little...!
Homer Simpson: (CHOKING SOUNDS, THEN:) All right! That's it. We're goin' home. I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!
Grampa Simpson: This tonic's caused me nothin' but trouble. (TO BOTTLE) You've done all the damage you're gonna do!
Grampa Simpson: If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic 38 years ago, you'da never been born and I'da been happy! You were an accident!!
Homer Simpson: (VERY HURT GASP, SCREAM)
Homer Simpson: (CREEPILY CALM) Get out.
Grampa Simpson: I'm sorry I said that.
Homer Simpson: Out.
Grampa Simpson: I'm gonna get out of the car, and I hope you'll find it in your heart not to drive awa--

Marge Simpson: You didn't want to have Bart.
Homer Simpson: I know, but you're never supposed to tell the child.
Marge Simpson: You tell Bart all the time. You told him this morning.
Homer Simpson: But when I do it, it's cute.
(Bart's Treehouse: INT. BART'S TREEHOUSE - NIGHT)
Bart Simpson: So, finally, we're all in agreement about what's going on with the adults. Milhouse?

(Simpson Kitchen: INT. SIMPSON Kitchen - the next day)
Homer Simpson: Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty... chewy... chocolatey... Put it away, boy... situation. And your daddy has realized something very important: a father should always make his kids feel wanted. Starting right now, I promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve.
Maggie Simpson: (OBLIVIOUS SUCK)
(Springfield Town Square: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - SECOND SMALL TOWN - DAY)
Grampa Simpson: Aw, nuts.
Homer Simpson: Dad!
Grampa Simpson: (FAST) And just feast your ears on this tantalizing testimonial from my own flesh and blood, the son who puts the fun in "Simpson & Son" -- my son, Barney!
Barney Gumble: (RECITING) I used to be a fat, disgusting slob. (BELCH)
Onlooker: That medicine seems to be givin' your son a lotta gas.
Grampa Simpson: I assure you his belching is the result of an unrelated alcohol problem.
Grampa Simpson: (WISTFUL SIGH) It just ain't the same without Homer. (BEAT) He knew how to drive a car.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON)
Homer Simpson: Son! My dear Son. From now on I'm going to be a good and attentive father. And for starters your "old man" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!

Homer Simpson: You're no girl, you're a boy. A good boy. You can be president. Scratch that. You will be president.
Lisa Simpson: (CALLING) Dad!
Homer Simpson: I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
Lisa Simpson: No, Dad. I want to get down. This tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me.
Homer Simpson: (PUSHING HER) Wheeee! Wheeee!!!
Lisa Simpson: No! No! No! No!!!
Bart Simpson: No offense, Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting.
Homer Simpson: (HURT) B-But I'm using my whole ass.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary.
Homer Simpson: (SADLY) Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking.
Bart Simpson: I'm sure he meant to say "serious drinking."
Lisa Simpson: That's what I assumed.
(Old Simpson Farmhouse: EXT. OLD SIMPSON FARMHOUSE - NIGHT)
(Simpson Farmhouse: INT. SIMPSON FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS)
Homer Simpson: Here's where it all started to go wrong. How'm I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself?
Homer Simpson: (MOAN) Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father... (THEN, A REVELATION) Wait a minute.
Homer Simpson: (SURPRISED) Dad? (TOUCHED) This photo is a blessing. It eases my pain. (BEAT, YELLS IN PAIN)
Homer Simpson: I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house.

Homer Simpson: (KIND) You know what?
Grampa Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: We're both screw-ups.
Grampa Simpson: It doesn't matter. What matters is you were right when you told me I never said anything nice about you.
Homer Simpson: (MOVED) So are you gonna say something nice now?
Grampa Simpson: Well, I hadn't thought that far ahead.
Grampa Simpson: (LOOKS IN HIS EYES) Okay, here it goes... I'm not sorry I had you, Son. And I was always proud that you weren't a short man.

Moe Szyslak: Yeah!
Homer Simpson: (PLEADING) Ah, come on, everybody. This bar is like a tavern to me.
Moe Szyslak: Sorry, Homer. You should have thought of that before you gave me the old sugar-me-do. I'm taking your caricature down from Mt. Lushmore.

Marge Simpson: What if you pretended that this couch were a bar? Then you could spend more nights at home with us. Huh?
Homer Simpson: I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.

Homer Simpson: (LYING) Yes. Cris-a-tunity. (WITH RISING CONVICTION) You're right! I've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. That's it. I'm going to find a new bar to drink in. And I'm gonna get drunker than I've been in my entire life! Bart, where's my wallet?

Marge Simpson: I don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden.
Homer Simpson: Come on Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you please?
(Airport: Ext. AIRPORT - establishing shot)
(Airplane: INT. AIRPLANE - coach class - continuous)
Homer Simpson: (EATING PEANUTS) So Marge, pretty sweet, eh?

Homer Simpson: I'm sure it's nothing.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, are you feeling any better?
Marge Simpson: Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.
Homer Simpson: Permit me to solve the mystery. Your mother has a fear of flying.
Bart Simpson: So much for the days when I could say "at least my mother's normal."
Marge Simpson: Well, everybody's got a fear of something.
Homer Simpson: (SMUGLY) Not everybody.
Marge Simpson: Sock puppets.
Homer Simpson: (JUMPS, TERRIFIED) Where? Where? (SCREAMS)
Lisa Simpson: Mom, are you sure you don't want to discuss it?
Marge Simpson: Sure as sugar. (ODD CHUCKLE)
Homer Simpson: Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. Push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again.
Lisa Simpson: But if we don't encourage her to vent her feelings, they can come out in other ways.
Marge Simpson: I just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog. They've been living in sin.

Lisa Simpson: Mom, can we talk to you?
Marge Simpson: Can't talk. Keeping myself in a state of cat-like readiness.
Lisa Simpson: Uh, neat... anyway, Mom, maybe you should go into therapy.
Marge Simpson: Mm, no, I don't need therapy, I'm fine. And it's too expensive.
Homer Simpson: And I don't believe in it. It breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.
Psychic: Hello, Radio Psychic. You will die a terrible, terrible death. Ooh I'm sorry, that was our last caller. Okay, I'm getting something now... huh?... Okay, you will die a terrible, terrible death.

Homer Simpson: Every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. Well what about me, Marge?
Homer Simpson: All right, Lisa, you got your way. Your mom's going to a psychiatrist. She's gonna tell Marge to leave me. It'll break up the family, and you'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I like picking beans with grandma.
Homer Simpson: Well keep it up, then.
Lisa Simpson: Okay, I will.
Homer Simpson: Good, you do that.
Lisa Simpson: Fine.
Homer Simpson: (BEAT) You'll be picking many a bean.
Lisa Simpson: Hope I do.
Bart Simpson: I don't believe it! Principal Skinner!
Bart Simpson: Well, well, well. I never thought I'd win this easy.

Homer Simpson: Keep sliding.
Marge Simpson: Thirty dollars will be fine.
Homer Simpson: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. First, what are your qualifications?
Dr. Zweig: Well...
Homer Simpson: Oh, no, I'm not here to take a reading test. I wanna see some credentials.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, doctor. He's just afraid you'll blame all my problems on him.
Dr. Zweig: I'm not here to blame anyone.
Dr. Zweig: Marge, therapy can be an intense process.
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR)
Dr. Zweig: We're going to delve deeply into your subconscious and we're not going to stop until we've exposed the root of your fear of flying.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED NOISE)
Dr. Zweig: Don't worry, this is a private sanctuary where whatever transpires will be just between us.
Dr. Zweig: Oh, that's just Murray, the window washer. He comes everyday at 12:00.
Marge Simpson: (LOOKING AT WATCH) But it's a few seconds before 12:00.
Homer Simpson: (ACCUSINGLY) You see?! You see?! "I" just left "my" first session and "I" haven't opened "my" mouth yet.
(Dr. Zweig's Office: INT. DR. ZWEIG'S OFFICE - LATER)
Dr. Zweig: Marge, there's no simple explanation for your fear of flying. But it can probably be traced to some childhood trauma. Think back, what's the earliest memory you have of something bad happening?

Marge Simpson: (MOVED SOUND)
(Simpson Living Room: INT. SIMPSON'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT)
Homer Simpson: (BLURTING TO MARGE) Did you talk about me in therapy today?

Marge Simpson: (CALLING AFTER IT) Wait! Daddy! Wait! Please don't leave. Take me with you!
(Dr. Zweig's Office: INT. DR. ZWEIG'S OFFICE)
Dr. Zweig: Marge, are you aware you just said "please don't leave" to your daddy?
Marge Simpson: No, I didn't.
Dr. Zweig: Yes, you did. And you also infringed on any number of copyrights. (PROBING) Now, let's talk about your father.
Marge Simpson: Sure, okay. I'll talk about father. Father Christmas. That's what they call Santa Claus in England. They drive on the wrong side of the road there. Now that's crazy. (WEAK LAUGH) People are always saying how small England is. But you couldn't fit it all in here. Not by a long shot. (UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGH) You know what? I'm cured.
Dr. Zweig: Marge get back here... and tell me about your father. What did he do for a living?
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR) Okay. Okay... But you're gonna make a big deal outta this. He was a pilot.
Dr. Zweig: A pilot? This is a big deal.
Marge Simpson: You see.
Dr. Zweig: Marge this may not be the best time to bring this up, but uh, your last check bounced.

Dr. Zweig: Yes. Thanks to trailblazers like your father. You might say he was a pioneer.
Marge Simpson: (BEAT) Yeah... You might even say he was an American hero.

Dr. Zweig: (STILL PEEVED) You know, Marge. We've really just begun to scratch the surface. There's still the far more serious problem of your husband.
Homer Simpson: That's okay. You don't have to make her into some kind of superwoman. She can get on a plane. That's plenty.

Lenny Leonard: Or save the life of a Stonecutter.

Homer Simpson: (SOLEMNLY) And by the Sacred Parchment I swear that if I reveal the secrets of the Stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.
Moe Szyslak: Um... I think he should have to take a different oath.
Number One: (FIRMLY) Everyone takes the same oath.

Carl Carlson: (HEMMING, HAWING)
Chief Wiggum: (HEMMING AND HAWING BETWEEN "YES" AND "NO")
Moe Szyslak: (FUMFERS, THEN) Run!
(Lisa's Classroom: int. lisa's classroom)
Seymour Skinner: The Grand Exalted Leader requests a moment of your time. (CLAPS HANDS) Class dismissed.
School Kids: Yay!
Homer Simpson: Lisa, you were right. My happiness is fading.
Lisa Simpson: You're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.
Homer Simpson: What do you mean, isolated? (ECHOING) ...ated...ated..ated..ated.
Lisa Simpson: Well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
Homer Simpson: Hm... I could help others. I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the Civil War (LAUGHS).
Lisa Simpson: Dad, that doesn't help people.
Homer Simpson: Couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
(Temple: Int. temple)
Homer Simpson: Brothers, brothers.
Stonecutters: (CHEER)
Marge Simpson: Aw, Homie. (BRIGHTENING) You know, you are a member of a very exclusive club.
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY SINCERE) Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson. Helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. So instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate.
Moe Szyslak: (SOTTO TO WIGGUM) He's gone mad with power. Like that Albert Schweitzer guy.
Moe Szyslak: Oh, for the love of God! Somebody get the jaws of life!
C. Montgomery Burns: (PAINED PUSHING SOUNDS)
Kid #3: (WHINY) Higher! Higher!
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh I'll give you higher, my filthy little urchin.
C. Montgomery Burns: You've won this round, but...
Woman: Oh, thank you Mr. Simpson. (SHE KISSES HIM) It looks so much better. A beautiful sky-blue.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house)
Homer Simpson: (HAPPY AND SERENE) You were right, Lisa. I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled. And with my brothers, the Stonecutters, behind me, this is the beginning of a better world for all of us.
(Temple: Int. temple - conference room)
Moe Szyslak: We gotta kill him.
Number One: Take it easy, Moe. Let's hear from the Stonecutter World Council before we act too rashly.
Redenbacher: Kill him!
NICHOLSON: Kill him!
Mr. T: Kill the fool!
BUSH: I'm afraid I have to disagree with Orville, Jack, and Mister. Can't we just do something to his voice box?
Number One: (SIGHS) We might as well face the truth. As long as we're Stonecutters, he will control our lives.
Moe Szyslak: (THOUGHTFULLY) Maybe... but maybe, we don't want to be Stonecutters no more.
(BASKIN ROBBINS: Ext. BASKIN ROBBINS)
Number One: Silence! I now call to order the first meeting of the Ancient Mystic Society of NoHomers.

Homer Simpson: Loyal stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg.
Homer Simpson: (SAD GROAN)
Marge Simpson: Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these Colobus monkeys. Somebody's gonna get parasites.
Homer Simpson: Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club.
Marge Simpson: (PATIENTLY) No. The family Simpson, which has just five members. (RE: WEDDING RING) And only two of those members have special rings.
Lisa Simpson: (TOGETHER) Yeah!
Marge Simpson: (OVER WHISTLE RINGS) I meant our wedding rings.
Homer Simpson: You know, Marge you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to.
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room)
Homer Simpson: (PAINED) This club'd better be worth it.
Marge Simpson: All right, all right. It's Lisa's turn.

Announcer: We now return to Knightboat: The Crime Solving Boat...
Knightboat's Partner: (TO BOAT) Faster Knightboat, we've got to catch those starfish poachers.
Knightboat: (WILLIAM DANIELS' VOICE, FILTERED; PETULANT) You don't have to yell Michael, I'm all around you.
Knightboat: Oh no! They're headed for land.
Knightboat's Partner: We'll never catch 'em now.
Knightboat: Incorrect. Look. A canal.
Homer Simpson: Go Knightboat, go!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - night)
Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED) Every week there's a canal.
Lisa Simpson: Or an inlet.
Bart Simpson: Or a fjord.
Homer Simpson: Quiet. (SHUTS EYES) I will not hear another word against the Boat.
Marge Simpson: Okay, TV off. It's family time.
Homer Simpson: (GROANS) But Marge, Knightboat. The crime solving boat.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you promised. One night of family time a week. Besides, that back-talking boat sets a bad example.
Bart Simpson: Says you, woman.
Marge Simpson: All right, family time begins now.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: (QUICKLY) It was Bart.
Lisa Simpson: Why don't we all look at the photo album?
Homer Simpson: (WISTFUL) So many memories. Aw, look... Knightboat.
Lisa Simpson: Aw.
Homer Simpson: Thanks honey. Bank shot.
Homer Simpson: And here's our TV next to the mirror. (PROUDLY) It looks like we have two.
Bart Simpson: Wow. Two.
Marge Simpson: (IMPATIENT) Yeah, yeah, yeah two. Let's get to the baby pictures.
Homer Simpson: (GROAN) Moom.
Homer Simpson: That's exciting.
Bart Simpson: Oh please.
Lisa Simpson: (GIGGLES)
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Marge Simpson: Here's Bart sleeping... Here he is dozing... Here he is after a visit from the sandman... Ooh, here's nappy-time Bart... Here's a cute one, he's all tuckered out...
Lisa Simpson: Why aren't there any pictures of Maggie?
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm glad you asked. It's actually a very interesting story.
Lisa Simpson: (UNHAPPY GROAN)
Homer Simpson: It all began about two years ago, before Maggie was even born. Bart, you were Lisa's age and Lisa (THINKING) you were the age Bart was several years ago.
Bart Simpson: Get the camera ready, Bart very seepy.
Homer Simpson: Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any TV show. (THEN, GRAND) It was a tumultuous time for our nation. The clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live. (MORE)
Homer Simpson: The Information Super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about "Star Trek," and the domestication of the dog continued unabated.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. power PLANT - homer's work station - day)
Homer Simpson: I was at my work station when suddenly...

Homer Simpson: (BRAVE) Not on my shift.
(Burns's Office: int. Mr. Burns' office)
Homer Simpson: Oh no you don't!
Homer Simpson: (SUAVE) Simpson ten, terrorists eight.
Marge Simpson: Homer! Tell the story right.
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Okay.
(PLANT: Int. plant - homer's workstation)
Carl Carlson: Homer, you should see a doctor. I don't think a healthy man could make that kind of a smell.
Waylon Smithers: Your paychecks, gentlemen.
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo! This is it! With this single glorious check, I'm finally completely out of debt.
Lisa Simpson: Good aim, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Yes! With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy job.
Lenny Leonard: But Homer, how're you gonna make a living?
Homer Simpson: Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan. A plan that'll fix you good.
Carl Carlson: Hey, what did we do?
Homer Simpson: Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss ya.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. POWER PLANT - MR. BURNS' OFFICE)
Homer Simpson: Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty. And since I quit, I can do anything I want.
C. Montgomery Burns: Is that so?
Homer Simpson: (COY) Ooh, lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone, oh, I don't know... didn't use a coaster!!
Homer Simpson: Such a nice tidy office. Maybe it's time you started living like a pig!
Homer Simpson: Oh, I hope I haven't upset you... bongo head!
C. Montgomery Burns: I should be resisting this, but I'm paralyzed with rage... and island rhythms.
(PLANT: Int. plant - corridor)
Carl Carlson: Yeah, way to play the boss' head like a bongo, Homer.
Lenny Leonard: (MOVING TO THE BEAT) He's gettin' a pretty good sound outta that guy.
Homer Simpson: That's for employing me for eight years! Ha ha.
Homer Simpson: (DUSTING HANDS) And that is that. Goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. Hello dream job in paradise.
(Somewhere: Int. somewhere)
Homer Simpson: (REVERENT SIGH) And now the final phase of my plan.
Homer Simpson: Hey Barney, any chance you can get me a job here?
Barney Gumble: Hey sure, Homer. I told you, my uncle owns the place.
Barney Gumble: Hey, Uncle Al, can Homer have a job?
Al: (GRUFF) Sure.
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo!
Al: Barney, you're fired.
Barney Gumble: Okay.
Al: (TO HOMER) Show up tomorrow. Bring three rags. Oh, and a change of pants.
Homer Simpson: Why?
Al: When it happens, you'll know.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - kitchen)
Bart Simpson: You're a pin-monkey? Wow. Finally I don't have to be ashamed of my father's job.
Lisa Simpson: I think it's romantic. Throwing off the shackles of the workaday world and following a dream... of sorts.
Marge Simpson: I don't know if it's such a good idea. Can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?
Homer Simpson: Don't worry, Marge. I've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. There will be exactly enough money for you, me, Bart and Lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices.
Marge Simpson: (SKEPTICAL MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: From now on we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy quilted kind...
Homer Simpson: And only one of you kids can go to college.
Lisa Simpson: Fine.
Homer Simpson: That night your mother and I went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. We began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...
Homer Simpson: (DREAMY) Marge...
Marge Simpson: (ALSO DREAMY) Homer...
Homer Simpson: I've got sand in my underpants.
Marge Simpson: Me too. Let's go home.

Marge Simpson: (DISGUSTED NOISE) Did you have to be so graphic?
Homer Simpson: It's okay, Marge. They pave the way for this kind of filth in school.
Lisa Simpson: So Dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?
Homer Simpson: (THEN, TO KIDS) Actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. At that time, I had no idea Maggie even existed.
Lisa Simpson: Daaad!
Homer Simpson: (OBLIVIOUSLY) Hi Maggie.
Homer Simpson: So anyhoo, back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant.
Marge Simpson: (RETCHING NOISES)
Homer Simpson: Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. I've got to wash my hair.
(Barney's Bowlarama: Int. bowling alley - day)
Homer Simpson: The next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.
Homer Simpson: Mmm... bowling fresh.
Homer Simpson: Mmm... urinal fresh.
Kent Brockman: In science: dead last.
Al: Homer, did you polish your head in the "Shine-O Ball-O?"
Homer Simpson: No.
Al: Okay then.
Homer Simpson: ...I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down.
Homer Simpson: I was in heaven. If horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well.
Customers: Hey, great job, Homer. / Thanks a lot./ You're the best. (ETC.)
Homer Simpson: (SINGING) I'M GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL!
(Dr. Hibbert's Office: Int. Doctor Hibbert's office)
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Congratulations Mrs. Simpson, you're pregnant.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED MURMUR)
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Am I to take it that this is... (CHUCKLE) an unwanted pregnancy?
Marge Simpson: Oh no, no. N-not exactly. It's just that I haven't told Homer yet; and with his new job, I don't know how we're going to be able to afford this.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, you know, a healthy baby can bring upwards of sixty-thousand dollars.
Marge Simpson: What?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (NERVOUS) Of course, that was just a test. Had you reacted differently, why you'd be in jail right now. Simply a test. (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - lisa's room)
Marge Simpson: So in a few months both of you will have a brand new brother or sister.

Marge Simpson: Why do you say that?
Lisa Simpson: Well, you've been in my room for about four hours now.
Marge Simpson: (TRYING TO BE CASUAL) Hey, I'm just hangin'.
Marge Simpson: Homie, I--
Homer Simpson: Can't talk, praying. (THEN) Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me and I am thankful. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is.
Marge Simpson: (SINKING MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: (SUSPICIOUS) Hey, wait a minute. What are all these presents? It looks like you're "showering" Marge with gifts.
Homer Simpson: (MODESTLY) Well, it was my major.
Homer Simpson: So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. (SHORT BEAT, THEN QUICKLY) Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. (BEAT) Thy will be done.

Marge Simpson: Oh yes.
Selma Bouvier: Gotta go.
Marge Simpson: Wait a minute, wait, I know that look. Now promise you won't tell Homer.
Selma Bouvier: Oh, we promise we won't tell... Homer.

Maude Flanders: By the way, congratulations on your new job, Homer.
Homer Simpson: New job?... Marge is pregnant?! Nooooo!
Bart Simpson: Wow, Dad. You really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?
Homer Simpson: Oh just that one time.
Marge Simpson: Actually, when I was about to have Bart...
Homer Simpson: You're pregnant?!
Marge Simpson: And then when I told him about Lisa...
Homer Simpson: You're pregnant again?!
Homer Simpson: Well who wouldn't be upset? That new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from Sunday! (TO BART AND LISA) Hey, where're you going?
Bart Simpson: Dad, you can't expect a person to sit for thirty minutes straight.
Lisa Simpson: I'm gonna get a snack and maybe go to the bathroom.
Marge Simpson: I'll stay here, but I'm gonna think about products I might like to purchase.
Marge Simpson: Ooh, I don't have that.
Homer Simpson: (MOAN) You're pregnant! We're gonna have to have a baby! All our financial plans are ruined. We're doomed! Doomed I tells ya!
Marge Simpson: Homer! Let your father tell the story.
Homer Simpson: (INDIGNANT) Yeah.
Bart Simpson: Okay, but I know funny.
Homer Simpson: Anyhoo...
Homer Simpson: (MUFFLED) We're doomed!
Marge Simpson: Homer, you had a head.
Homer Simpson: Check.
Marge Simpson: And your bottom was a little bigger.
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Marge Simpson: You've worked hard at the bowling alley. Why don't you ask for a raise?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, a raise! I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. But I'm damn good at this one. (DETERMINED) That's it! I'm gonna march right up to Al and say...
(Barney's Bowlarama: Int. bowling alley)
Homer Simpson: Steve -- I mean Al, I think I deserve a raise.
Al: Well, you're a hard worker and I'd like to give you a raise, but the alley just ain't doin' enough business to pay that kind of money.
Legs: When he's done in there, I gotta go.
Homer Simpson: How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise?
Al: Well yeah, but how--
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - dining room)
Homer Simpson: Of course!
(Barney's Bowlarama: Ext. bowling alley)
Homer Simpson: Bowling! Bowling here! (FIRES) Come bowl now! Get yer bowling! Who's ready?! Bowling!
Lisa Simpson: Mom! Make Dad tell the story right.
Marge Simpson: (QUIETLY) That's what really happened.
Lisa Simpson: (EMBARRASSED) Oh.
Homer Simpson: My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. I failed. Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done.
Al: You did a great job Homer, and I'm really gonna miss you. The place has never been cleaner, and the way you kept the young people away... That was beautiful.
Various Patrons: (AD-LIB AGREEMENT)
Al: Anyway, we all pitched in and we got you this little goin' away thing.
Homer Simpson: (CHOKING UP) This was the happiest time of my life. I'll never forget you guys. Especially you, Joey.

Receptionist: (SWEETLY) Yes, are you a new applicant?
Homer Simpson: Actually, I quit and I came to get my job back.
Receptionist: (SUDDENLY NASTY) Through there.
C. Montgomery Burns: So, come crawling back, eh?
Homer Simpson: Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
(Homer's Workstation: int. homer's work station)
Homer Simpson: (VERY SAD) Thanks for giving me my old job back.
C. Montgomery Burns: (OMINOUS) I'm afraid it's not that simple. As punishment for your desertion, it's company policy to give you the plague.
Waylon Smithers: Uh sir, that's the plaque.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah yes, the special demotivational plaque, to break what's left of your spirit. Because, you see, you're here forever.
C. Montgomery Burns: "Don't forget, you're here forever."
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - that evening)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) I've never been so miserable in all my life. But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids. I've got to carry the burden all by myself.
Homer Simpson: (VERY SWEETLY) Hi honey, how are you?
Marge Simpson: Well, actually -
Homer Simpson: I can't go on with this charade any longer. I hate my job. I hate my life. And ever since I found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck.
Marge Simpson: My contractions started an hour ago.
Homer Simpson: It's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it, Marge.

Homer Simpson: It's wonderful! It's magical! Oh boy, here it comes - another mouth.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: One more push should do it.
Homer Simpson: (FAKE ENTHUSIASM) Marvelous.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. You have a beautiful, healthy baby.
Homer Simpson: (TRYING TO SOUND ENTHUSED) Okay.
Homer Simpson: (CONFUSED SOUND)

Seymour Skinner: (TO HIMSELF) Hurrah for science, woo? I can't say I approve of the woo, but the hurrah was quite heartening. (TO WILLIE) Release the balloon.
Nerds: Yayyyy!
Kids: (LAUGH)
Seymour Skinner: (LOUD WAIL) Nooooooo!
Bart Simpson: I don't think I really captured the eyes.
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, if you have a failing, it's that you're always demanding perfection. If you have a failing.

Pilot: This is what happens when you cut money out of the military and put it into health care.
Pilot #2: It's a good program. Just give it a chance, that's all I ask.
Seymour Skinner: It won't come down for months. Curse the man who invented helium. Curse Pierre Jules Cesar Janssen! (BEAT) Now to find out who did this.
Seymour Skinner: Bart? Empty your pockets.
Bart Simpson: And you've never found anything?
Bart Simpson: Empty my pockets you say? Well, certainly, but I fail to see how...
Seymour Skinner: Hmmm... blueprints of the dummy, ... notarized photos of you making the dummy... and an alternate wording for the banner: "Buttzilla."
Bart Simpson: Race you to Utah, Milhouse.
Milhouse Van Houten: Okay.
Seymour Skinner: I am going to punish you for this, Bart. And it won't just be a simple caning this time.
Seymour Skinner: Because you have impeded science, you must now aid science. (WARMING TO IDEA) Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will assist me with my amateur astronomy. Taking down coordinates, carrying equipment and so forth. Four-thirty in the morning.
Bart Simpson: There's a four-thirty in the morning now?
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - 4 am next morning - establishing)
Radio Announcer: Top of the hour. Time for the morning news. But, of course, there is no news yet. Everyone's still asleep. In their comfy, comfy beds. (QUIETLY) Good night everybody.
Bart Simpson: Mom, will you make me breakfast?
Marge Simpson: (SLEEPY MURMUR) There's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last night. (FALLING ASLEEP) Just rinse it good...
Small Boy: Come home, Lassie! Here boy! C'mon girl! Atta boy!
Bart Simpson: Still dark. Better use the generator.
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. springfield elementary - establishing)
Seymour Skinner: Ah, there's nothing more exciting than science. You get all the fun of sitting still, being quiet, writing down numbers, paying attention... Science has it all!
Bart Simpson: Is that the telescope we're gonna be looking through?
Seymour Skinner: Yes, but you won't be looking through it. (CHUCKLES) I forbid it. But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart. (POINTING) There are all the constellations you've heard so much about.
Seymour Skinner: There's Orion... the Swan...the chariot race...
Bart Simpson: Why don't they look anything like their names?
Seymour Skinner: Well, you do have to use your imagination. Look, there's the Three Wise Men.
Bart Simpson: (TRACE OF DISGUST) Who names these things anyway?
Seymour Skinner: Whoever discovers them. I've been hoping I could find something that would be named after me.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - ESTABLISHING)
Seymour Skinner: (A LITTLE DARK) Once. But by the time I got to a phone, my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kohoutek. (VERY DARK) I got back at him though. Him and that little boy of his. (NORMAL) Anyway... that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me. Now, this morning we're gonna be mapping a small square of sky that's thought to be empty. It's my hope that it's not.
Bart Simpson: So what am I supposed to do exactly?

Seymour Skinner: (GREAT ANTICIPATION) Six hours, nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees fifty-eight minutes declination... (BEAT) No sighting. Did you get that one, Bart?

Seymour Skinner: It's coming pretty close to the ground. Maybe I can catch it. Don't touch the telescope, Bart. Even a slight change in elevation can destroy a whole morning's work.

Female Astronomer: (ON PHONE) Congratulations, Bart. You've just discovered a comet.
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. Springfield elementary - track field)
Seymour Skinner: NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
Seymour Skinner: (OFF BALLOON) NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
Seymour Skinner: NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
Homer Simpson: ...And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.
Lisa Simpson: Sounds like you had a good day today, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, except I forgot to go to work.
Marge Simpson: What did you do today, Bart?
Bart Simpson: What didn't I do.
Marge Simpson: (READING) "Boy Discovers Comet."
Lisa Simpson: What!?
Marge Simpson: (READING) "A young Springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known as 'The Bart Simpson Comet.'" Oh honey, I'm so proud of you.
Bart Simpson: (PROMPTING HER) But then, you've always been proud of me.
Marge Simpson: (SLOWLY) Yes.
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. Springfield elementary - cafeteria - next day)
Ham: Won't you join us, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Uh... I guess so.
Database: As the first student at Springfield Elementary to discover a comet, we're very proud to make you a member of our very select group. Welcome to SuperFriends!
Bart Simpson: Huh?
Nerds: Welcome, SuperFriend!
Ham: I am called "Ham," since I enjoy ham radio. This is "E-Mail," "Cosine," "Report Card," "Database" and "Lisa". Your nickname will be "Cosmos."
Bart Simpson: Well I'm done eating. Goodbye.
Nerds: Goodbye Cosmos! / Bye-bye!
Database: Perhaps some night you could show us your comet.
Bart Simpson: There it is right there.
Database: I make it a point never to turn my head unless I expect to see something, Bart. Naturally we can't see your comet in broad daylight and without a telescope.
Bart Simpson: (LOSING PATIENCE) But you don't need a stupid telescope. It's right there.
E-Mail: Oh no no no no! This isn't right at all!
Database: It must be coming toward us at a fantastic speed.
Bart Simpson: Huh?
Lisa Simpson: Don't you realize what's happening, Bart? Your comet is gonna collide with the earth and every living thing in its path will be killed.
Bart Simpson: I knew you'd try to find something wrong with my comet Lisa. You've always been petty and small. Right from the beginning.
Report Card: We must alert the proper authorities.
E-Mail: To the observatory!
(OBSERVATORY: Ext. observatory)
SUPERFRIENDS: (SINGING) We are the SuperFriends...
Bart Simpson: Hey, shut up.
Male Astronomer: (QUIETLY) Dear God.
Female Astronomer: Warren, we've talked about you hogging the eyepiece.
(Springfield: Ext. Springfield - main street)
Grampa Simpson: Sounds like the Doomsday Whistle. Ain't been blown for nigh on to three years.
Jasper Beardly: (NODS HEAD AND CLUCKS TONGUE) Trouble a brewin'.
(Springfield Town Hall: Int. town hall)
Mayor Joe Quimby: Fellow citizens, when I learned about the impending crisis, I caught the very next plane to Springfeld - field.
Mayor Joe Quimby: First of all, yes, there is a comet in the sky, and yes, it is going to hit Springfield.
Mayor Joe Quimby: You uh, don't need to applaud that. Now, here's what we think the impact might look like. Show them, Jerry.
Moe Szyslak: Oh dear God, no!
Mayor Joe Quimby: Fortunately we have a plan. Professor Frink?
Professor Jonathan Frink: Good evening, ladies and...
Panicked Man: Quit stalling! What's the plan?!
Professor Jonathan Frink: Alright, just take your seat, just take your seat.
Professor Jonathan Frink: Now, working with former Carter Administration officials and military men who were forced into early retirement for various reasons, which we won't go into here (FRINK NOISE), we have planned this defense for the city.
Professor Jonathan Frink: As the comet hurtles toward the city, our rocket will intercept it and blow it to smithereens.
Moe Szyslak: Oh, dear God, no!
Mayor Joe Quimby: ...and that will be the end of Mr. Comet.
Townspeople: Yay! / We're saved! / Etc.
Townspeople: (LAUGH COCKILY)
(Simpson Car: Int. Simpson car)
Homer Simpson: Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed. Didn't you hear what the guy in the building said?
Lisa Simpson: But, Dad, don't you think...
Congressman #1: Then it is unanimous. We are going to approve the bill to evacuate the town of Springfield in the great state of...
Homer Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. Didn't they?
Lisa Simpson: No, Dad, I don't think...
Homer Simpson: (INTERRUPTING, RAISING FINGER) There's that word again.
(Springfield: EXT. SPRINGFIELD - night)
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - roof)
Marge Simpson: Homer, what if this doesn't work?
Homer Simpson: Well then, I have a back-up plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going (MAKES DOPEY "OTHER" PEOPLE SOUNDS) doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo... (ETC.)
Bart Simpson: Dad, the plan!
Homer Simpson: I'm getting to that. So anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo... (ETC.)
Bart Simpson: Dad!
Homer Simpson: So anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo... (ETC.)
Lisa Simpson: Daaad, they're firing the rocket!
Homer Simpson: All right!
Townspeople: (CHEERING) YAYYYY! (ETC.)
Townspeople: (À LA CHARLES NELSON REILLEY) Gllllll.
Lisa Simpson: It blew up the bridge!
Bart Simpson: We're doomed!
Homer Simpson: It's at times like this I wish I were a religious man.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: It's all over, people! We don't have a prayer! (SCREAMS)
Kent Brockman: And, like Icarus, the rocket foolishly soared too high and lost control of its servo-guidance mechanism, leaving us with some... (LOOKS AT WATCH) six hours to live. So! Let's go live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of town, with Arnie Pye and "Arnie In The Sky."
Arnie Pye: With the bridge gone, and the airport unfortunately on the other side of the bridge, a number of citizens are attempting to jump the gorge with their cars. (MORE)
Arnie Pye: It's a silent testament to the "never give up" and "never think things out" spirit of our citizens.
Kent Brockman: With our utter annihilation imminent, our Federal Government has snapped into action. We go live now via satellite to the floor of the United States Congress ...
(House Of Representatives: Ext. House of Representatives - establishing)
(House Of Representative: Int. house of representative - continuous)
Lisa Simpson: It's a pony.
Congressman #2: (INTERRUPTING) Wait a second, I want to tack on a rider to that bill. Thirty million dollars of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts.
Congressman #1: All in favor of the amended Springfield-slash-Pervert bill?
Congress: Boo!
Congressman #1: Bill defeated.
Kent Brockman: I've said it before and I'll say it again. Democracy simply doesn't work. Now, over the years, a newsman learns a number of things that, for one reason or another, he just cannot report. It doesn't seem to matter now, so... the following people are gay.
Marge Simpson: Turn it off.
Homer Simpson: Just a second.
Homer Simpson: What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet. Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head.
Bart Simpson: Wow, Dad. Maybe you're right.
Homer Simpson: Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow.
Lisa Simpson: (WORRIED GROAN)
Homer Simpson: Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter.
Lisa Simpson: We have a bomb shelter?
Homer Simpson: (PROUDLY) Homer Simpson takes care of his family.
(Flanders Backyard: Ext. Flanders' backyard)
Homer Simpson: (CALLING) Flanders! Open up!
Ned Flanders: Hi-de-ho-e-roonie, neighbor. What can I do you for?
Homer Simpson: Get out of there. My family needs to use your bomb shelter.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) I kinda figured this might happen, so I built the shelter big enough for both our families.
Homer Simpson: No deal. Out.
Marge Simpson: Get in the shelter, Homer.
(BOMB SHELTER: Int. bomb shelter)
Marge Simpson: One more hour.
Homer Simpson: An hour! I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?
Homer Simpson: THERE it is.
Ned Flanders: Well, Howdilly doodilly neighbors. Shouldn't you be in your sheltereenees by now?
Moe Szyslak: (OMINOUSLY) We haven't got sheltereenees. We want in yours.
Ned Flanders: (APOLOGETIC) Well sorry, the shelter's kinda full.
Moe Szyslak: Really? (THEN, OBLIGINGLY) Oh. Well, we'll just go off someplace and die then. Thanks.
Ned Flanders: Wait!
Ned Flanders: I may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive, but oh, what the hey...
Townspeople: (CHEER)
Krusty the Clown: All right!
Homer Simpson: I can't get the... (STRUGGLING SOUNDS) I can't get the door closed. Somebody's going to have to get out.
Lisa Simpson: (MUFFLED) I'd get out, but I don't know where I am.
Barney Gumble: Hey, somebody's touching me.
Seymour Skinner: I am.
Barney Gumble: Oh, okay.
Krusty the Clown: Okay, okay, let's figure out who should stay. (BEGINS TO MAKE A LIST) Let's see... the world of the future will need laughter, so I'm in.
Moe Szyslak: And it will need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me. Um, and someone will have to run the power. Uh, you can do that, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (LYING) Uh, yeah. I can do that.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Okay, let's start again. We'll need laughter, religious enlightenment, gossip -- that's Mrs. Lovejoy...
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. That's you, Flanders.
Homer Simpson: (HUSHED VOICE TO KIDS) I'm terribly sorry. (NORMAL VOICE) Flanders is the only useless person here. If anyone dies, it should be him. (HUSHED) I'm sorry. Please forgive me. (NORMAL VOICE) So let's kick Flanders out. (HUSHED) Sorry.
Ned Flanders: (STOIC) Well sir, sounds fair. Toodle-oo, everybody. I'll, I'll scream when the comet gets here.
Maude Flanders: Oh, I'm coming with you, Neddy.
Ned Flanders: No, sweetheart, you stay here because--
Maude Flanders: (INTERRUPTING) Okay.
Ned Flanders: I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in.
Todd Flanders: (SAD) Okay, Dad.
Ned Flanders: Okay.
Ned Flanders: (SINGING) QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE / THE FUTURE'S NOT OURS TO SEE...
Moe Szyslak: Hey, I got an idea. We can play a game to pass the time. Uh, I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal, and uh, you all try to guess what it is. (CLEARS THROAT)
Chief Wiggum: It's a pig!
Bart Simpson: It's a cow, man.
(GANGSTERS CAR: int. gangsters car)
Krusty the Clown: No, it's a goat. You know, one of them lady goats.
Selma Bouvier: There are no lady goats. A lady goat is a sheep.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: I believe she's right.
Otto Mann: You're crazy.
Captain Horatio McCallister: Arrr, what's it to ya?
Otto Mann: What's it to me?
Marge Simpson: Stop it, stop it. Can't you see this barnyard noise guessing game is tearing us apart?!
Ned Flanders: (FROM A DISTANCE) QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE...
Marge Simpson: Say Moe, was it a duck?
Homer Simpson: No, no! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it, stop it! I can't take this anymore. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. Especially his children. I'm goin' out there.
Homer Simpson: (QUICKLY) And it was a baby ox.
Moe Szyslak: He's right, ya know.
Seymour Skinner: About the ox?
Moe Szyslak: About everything, dammit! Hey, Homer, wait up! I wanna die too!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: If you are going, I'm going.

Townspeople: Yay!
Patty Bouvier: Sure makes you appreciate the preciousness of life.
Moe Szyslak: Let's go burn down the observatory so this'll never happen again.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - later)
Lisa Simpson: I can't believe that extra thick layer of pollution that I've actually picketed against is what burned up the comet.
Bart Simpson: What's really amazing is that this is exactly what Dad said would happen.
Lisa Simpson: (STUNNED) Yeah, dad was right.
Homer Simpson: I know kids, I'm scared too.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
(Australia: EXT. AUSTRALIA - DAY)

Krusty the Clown: See you tomorrow, kids. (KRUSTY LAUGH) But before I go I'd just like to say...
(Krustylu Studios: int. Krusty studio - backstage)
Krusty the Clown: Ahh, there's nothing better than a cigarette, UNLESS it's a cigarette lit with a $100 bill.
Krusty the Clown: (VERY FAST) Put five thousand bucks on the Lakers... Hire Kenny G to play for me in the elevator... My house is dirty, buy me a clean one...

Krusty the Clown: Did you send those thousand roses to Bea Arthur's grave?
Accountant: Yes, but she's still...
Krusty the Clown: I don't want to hear the end of any sentences...
Secretary: (THROUGH INTERCOM) George Carlin on three.
Krusty the Clown: Yeah? (LISTENS) Lawsuit? Oh, come on! My "Seven words you can't say on TV" bit was entirely different from your "Seven words you can't say on TV" bit. (LISTENS) So I'm a thief, am I? Well exCUSE MEEEEEEEEE!
Krusty the Clown: (TO ACCOUNTANT) Give him ten grand.
Secretary: (THROUGH INTERCOM) Steve Martin on four.
Krusty the Clown: Ten grand.
Fat Tony: Krusty, in regards to the large wager you made on yesterday's horse race...
Krusty the Clown: Oh, come on. How about letting me go double or nothing on the big opera tonight?
Fat Tony: Who do you like?
Krusty the Clown: The tenor.
Fat Tony: (THINKS FOR A MOMENT) Okay. But we're only letting the bet ride because you crack us so consistently... up.
Accountant: You've got to stop blowing your money like this, Krusty.
Krusty the Clown: No can do.
Accountant: And those ridiculous bets you make! Gambling is the finest thing a person can do, if he's good at it. But you haven't won anything in months.
Krusty the Clown: (SHRUGS) So I'll just make some more money. Crank out some cheesy merchandise.
Homer Simpson: I am holding still. I am squirming.
(Australian House: INT. AUSTRALIAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS)
Accountant: But you've already merchandized everything: Krusty's Monopoly Game,... the Krusty Krowd Kontrol Barrier. Nothing is selling anymore. Not even your new "Lady Krusty" line.
Krusty the Clown: But our info-mercials are running twenty-four hours a day.
Johnny Unitas: (KNOWINGLY) So, what do you think of the Lady Krusty Moustache Removal System now, Angelique?
Angelique: It's Krusterific, Johnny Unitas, but is my upper lip supposed to bleed like this?
Johnny Unitas: (SHRUGS) Probably.
Accountant: At this rate you'll be broke in a month. The only thing left to do is to open a clown college and train some "regional" Krustys.
Krusty the Clown: You mean like that bozo, Bonko the Clown?
Accountant: Exactly.
Krusty the Clown: Forget it. I'll just cut back on the condor egg omelettes. (LICKING HIS LIPS) Mmmm, a couple of those would be tasty right now.
Accountant: I'll found the college tomorrow.
(Freeway: ext. freeway)
Homer Simpson: (GASP) It must be the first of the month! New billboard day!

Homer Simpson: (READING) "This year give her English Muffins." (SALUTES) Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard.
Homer Simpson: (READING) "Best in the West." (CHUCKLES) It rhymes.
Homer Simpson: (SNORTS DISAPPROVINGLY) Clown college? You can't eat that.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - Homer's work station)
Homer Simpson: (SATISFIED) Well, I got everything I was supposed to get. I'm not going to enroll in that clown college though. That advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever.

Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Clowns are funny.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house)
Lisa Simpson: Mom?
Marge Simpson: I think I'll have some wine.
Homer Simpson: (SLOWLY) Marge.
Marge Simpson: Yes, Homie? (MAKES SMALL CALLIOPE NOISE)
Homer Simpson: That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. (PROCLAMATION) I'm going to clown college!
Bart Simpson: I don't think any of us expected him to say that.
Homer Simpson: Hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.
Marge Simpson: Hold still, Homer. Don't squirm.
Bart Simpson: Dad, you can't just go around pretending to be Krusty. It's sacrilege. He's a one and only. I mean, he invented the pie fight, the prat fall, and the seltzer bottle... as far as I know.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley. But Krusty!
Homer Simpson: You weren't complaining when I got you this close to Chachi.
Bart Simpson: What's a Chachi?

Krusty the Clown: Okay, we'll start off with the baggy p...wha?
Krusty the Clown: Those are supposed to be baggy pants. Baggy!
Homer Simpson: Ooh, I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life.
Krusty the Clown: Okay, memorize these funny place names. Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga, Seattle...
Homer Simpson: (LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY) Stop it! You're killing me! Seattle... (CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Krusty the Clown: And now everybody's favorite, the "spin cycle fantastique" trick. It's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off, but if you blow it, you'll look like a fool.
Homer Simpson: Steady, steady...
Krusty the Clown: Now, when the wealthy dowager comes in, the party's over, right? Wrong.
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Kill wealthy dowager.
Krusty the Clown: Uh, burn that seat.
Krusty the Clown: These Krusty brand balloons are three bucks each, but get a cheap one and what happens? It goes off, takes out the eyeballs of every kid in the room. What's that gonna cost yA? (TURNS TO ACCOUNTANT) Hey Bill, what did that cost us?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house)
Homer Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Bart Simpson: (SPUTTERING) Wow. I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad.
Lisa Simpson: If there has to be a bastardized version of Krusty, I'm glad it's you.
Krusty the Clown: Welcome to the noble family of skilled Krustaceans. You will now go back to your hometowns and do kids' parties, swap meets, and all the other piddling crap I wouldn't touch with a ten foot clown pole. (HOLDING UP DIPLOMA) Now come and get your cat skins -- Uh, I mean sheep skins.

Bart Simpson: I have a feeling I could get him to appear at my house.

Lenny Leonard: Wow, jiffy lube.
Grampa Simpson: You've stolen my soul.
Carl Carlson: Boy, you're really running yourself ragged.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah. When I started this clown thing I thought it would be nothing but glory. You know, the glory of being a clown? I tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when I see the smiles on their little faces, I just know they're getting ready to jab me with something.

Homer Simpson: (GRUMBLING) Being a clown sucks. You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. Who am I clowning? I have no business being a clown. I'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business.
Homer Simpson: Oh no.
Chief Wiggum: Well, well, well "Velocity Boy," I am gonna give you the biggest ticket you... (SUDDENLY DELIGHTED) Hey! Krusty!
Homer Simpson: (BITTER) I'm not Krusty.
Chief Wiggum: Oh, to think I was going to give you a ticket! Krusty the Klown!
Homer Simpson: (FIRMLY) I am not Krusty.
Chief Wiggum: Hey Krusty, Krusty, remember the time we got loaded and set those beavers loose in that pine furniture store? (CHUCKLES) Memories. All right, you take it easy, Krusty.

Krusty the Clown: (NERVOUSLY) Mind if I go to the bathroom first?
Fat Tony: I see no harm in that.
Fat Tony: Okay, wherever Krusty's gone, we'll find him. Legs, you check out the East Side. Louie, Rome and Budapest. Tell the boys I want a total world search.

Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLE) Lucky I was wearing an extra large piece of the True Cross today. (A LITTLE WORRIED) I think I'll go inside.

Fat Tony: I told you we should've bought more than three bullets. Let's just grab him.
Homer Simpson: (SURPRISED, THEN STRUGGLING NOISES)
(GANGSTER'S CAR: int. gangster's car)
Homer Simpson: But wait. You can't kill me for being Krusty. I'm not him. I'm Homer Simpson.
Fat Tony: The same Homer Simpson who crashed his car through the wall of our club?
Homer Simpson: Uh... actually my name is Barney. Yeah. Barney Gumbel.
Legs: The same Barney Gumbel who keeps taking pictures of my sister?
Homer Simpson: Uh... actually my real name is uh... (TO HIMSELF) Think, Krusty, think... Joe Valachi.
Louie: The same Joe Valachi who squealed to the Senate Committee about organized crime?

Don Vitorio: I am so glad I had a chance to meet you before we did this, Krusty, because I am a great-a fan. (EXTENDS HAND) Don Vittorio Dimaggio.
Homer Simpson: (DEFEATED) Krusty the clown.
Don Vitorio: Sorry, I have to do this, Krusty.
Don Vitorio: I cannot do it. To murder a funnyman of such genius would be a crime. (THINKS) Tell you what, Krusty. Do for me my favorite trick where you ride the little bike through the loop, and I will let you live.
Homer Simpson: But, I've never been able to do the...
Homer Simpson: How 'bout if I just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere?
Homer Simpson: Okay.
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) I'll never be able to do this trick... never.
Don Vitorio: Go! Go!
Homer Simpson: Hey! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm the greatest clown in the world!
Don Vitorio: (GRIMLY) The fact that you did not do the trick well is the biggest insult of all.
Krusty the Clown: Hey, guys, I came to uh... (LOOKS AROUND) Uh, you've got a deadly game of cat and mouse goin'. I'll come back.
Legs: (RUBBING EYES) I'm seeing double here. Four Krustys.
Bart Simpson: (DEEP VOICE) Payroll. Burt Stanton speaking.
Homer Simpson: (DELIGHTED) Krusty! Oh thanks! Thanks a lot! You came here to save me!
Krusty the Clown: (EYES DARTING) Yeah, that's what I did.
Don Vitorio: (TO HOMER) My apologies to you. I almost made a grievous error.
Don Vitorio: Goodbye, Krusty.
Krusty the Clown: Wait! He can't kill anybody if he doesn't know which one's the real Krusty!
Don Vitorio: I am confused.
Homer Simpson: Heh-heh, good one, Krusty.
Krusty the Clown: Oh crap.
Don Vitorio: Because of that disrespectful display, I shall now kill both of you... Unless... you both go through the loop. Together.
Krusty the Clown: I can't see, you idiot! Take your hands off my eyes!
Krusty the Clown: Uh-ho.
Don Vitorio: Without the loop, it is nothing.
Homer Simpson: Ta-Da!
Gangsters: Yayyyyy Krustys!
Don Vitorio: Grazie. Grazie. You have brought great joy to this old Italian stereotype.
Legs: No, no, Don Vittorio, you're not.
Don Vitorio: (MODEST) Yes I am. I know it. I am. Anyway, thank-a you, Krusty.
Krusty the Clown: You're welcome. So, we're even now, huh?
Don Vitorio: No. We just won't kill you. But you still owe us the money. (DRAMATICALLY) Forty-eight dollars.
Krusty the Clown: Here's fifty.
Don Vitorio: And two, your change. And we thank you.

Bart Simpson: No fair! You only won 'cause you had the inside track! If the water was spinning the other way--
Lisa Simpson: It never spins the other way. In the Northern hemisphere, water always drains counter-clockwise. It's called the Coriolis effect.
Bart Simpson: No way. Water doesn't obey your "rules." It goes where it wants. Like me, babe.
Lisa Simpson: (ROLLING EYES) Yes, Bart. Why don't you try it and see?
Bart Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED GROAN) I know I've seen it go the other way. (LOOKING AROUND) Ah, faithful toilet. You'll prove me right.

Lisa Simpson: Bart, water will only go the other way in the Southern Hemisphere.
Bart Simpson: What the hell is the Southern Hemisphere?
Lisa Simpson: (SIGH) Haven't you ever looked at your globe?
Lisa Simpson: See, the Southern Hemisphere is made up of everything below the Equa...(LOOKS AT BART) this line.
Bart Simpson: (SKEPTICAL) Hmm, so down there in, say, Argentina or Rand-McNally all their water runs backwards?

Operator: This is the international operator. Will you accept a collect call from...
Bart Simpson: (TRYING TO SOUND ADULT) Er, uh, this is Dr. Bart Simpson of the International Drainage Commission. It's an emergency.
Little Boy: If it's an emergency, then.
Bart Simpson: We understand some drains in your area have been malfunctioning, sucking in people and what-not.
Little Boy: Whillikers! That's orful!
Bart Simpson: Indeed. We need you to check your sinks and toilets and tell us which way the water is going. And, please -- stand clear!
Little Boy: The fixtures, they're all draining clockways, sir.

Marge Simpson: (READING IT) "Undersecretary for International Protocol. Brat and Punk Division."
Evan Conover: Unfortunately, Bart, your little "escapade" could not have come at a worse time. Americo-Australianian relations are at an all-time low.
Evan Conover: As I'm sure you remember, in the late 1980's, the U.S. experienced a short-lived infatuation with Australian culture.
Evan Conover: For some bizarre reason, the Aussies thought this would be a permanent thing. Of course, it wasn't.
Lisa Simpson: (CONFUSED) I know those words, but that sign makes no sense.
Evan Conover: Anyway, the "down under" fad fizzled, and the diplomatic climate turned absolutely frosty.
Evan Conover: Oops. Let's pretend we didn't see that.
Evan Conover: And Bart's childish taunting agitated the Aussies further.
Homer Simpson: Oh, he'll agitate ya. Ho, ho. He sure will. (CHUCKLES, THEN STOPS AWKWARDLY) What can we do for you?
Evan Conover: Well, it's too late to merely pay back the money, but as a sign of good faith to our Australian friends, we'd like to imprison Bart for five years.
Homer Simpson: That's tough but fair. Boy, go with the man.
Marge Simpson: No, no, no, no! I'm not gonna have my son go to jail over some silly tiff with Australia! You'll just have to find some other country to have relations with.
Evan Conover: You're sure now, the prison train is sailing... Okay, I'm not hearing a lot of support for prison. There is one other option. They'll drop the charges if... Bart makes a public apology in Australia.
Homer Simpson: All Bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to Australia?
Bart Simpson: I can handle that. I'm an expert at phony apologies.
Marge Simpson: Bart!

Bart Simpson: Yeah. Do the toilets go backwards in here?

Homer Simpson: Punishment?!
Prime Minister: Well, a mere apology would be a bit empty, eh? Let the booting begin!
Homer Simpson: Booting?
Prime Minister: Oh, it's just a little kick in the bum.
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS) Yuh-oh.
Homer Simpson: (ANGUISHED) What kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot?!
Evan Conover: Mr. Simpson, shhsh! Disparaging the boot is a bootable offense. It's one of their proudest traditions.
Homer Simpson: You sold us out, Conover!
Homer Simpson: (DESPERATE) Stay back or I'll boot your Prime Minister! I'll do it! So help me God I'll boot him!
Homer Simpson: When will you Australians learn? In America, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. The streets are safe. Old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. And the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. So, like us, let your children run wild and free. Because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. Now boy, run back to the embassy! Back to American soil!
Guard: I'll stop them!
Australian: Oh, no! It's coming back this way!

Moe Szyslak: Hey, hey! Are you a loan shark? Do you understand how finance works? (HE PULLS OUT A HUGE SLEDGE-HAMMER) Now let's do this thing.
(Springfield Elementary School Gym: INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GYM - LATER)
Bart Simpson: Oh no. It's P.E. sign up day!
Lisa Simpson: How could you forget? They had signs posted all over the library.

Nelson Muntz: So did Tae Kwon Do.
Bart Simpson: (PANICKED GROAN)
Homer Simpson: Rye am Romer Rimpson...
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLES) There is only one class left, but it happens to be the "coolest" one of all.
Bart Simpson: Ballet? Dancin' is for girls!
Seymour Skinner: (SHRUGGING) Well you should have gotten here earlier.
(First National Bank of Springfield: INT. FIRST BANK OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY)
Homer Simpson: Uh, I need an another extension on my mortgage payments.
Lender: I understand that, Mr. Simpson. But according to our computer, your credit history is not good. (HE PUNCHES IN SOME DATA) It says here that you've been pre-declined for every major credit card. It also says that you once grabbed a dog by the hind legs and pushed him around like a vacuum cleaner.
Homer Simpson: That was in the third grade.
Lender: Yeah, well it all goes on your permanent record. I'm sorry, but if you don't come up with that money by tomorrow-- the bank is going to take your house.
Homer Simpson: (DEFIANT) Well, good luck finding it because I'm gonna take the numbers off tonight.
Lender: Well we'll look for the house with no numbers.
Homer Simpson: Then I'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.
Lender: Well then we'll look for the house next to the house with no numbers.
Homer Simpson: (BEAT) All right, you'll get your money.
(DOORWAY: INT. DOORWAY)
Homer Simpson: You're my last-last chance, bottom of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot, wish you would do it but probably won't, final resort, to lend me money.

Lisa Simpson: You're certainly in a good mood tonight, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today. And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair.
Homer Simpson: Mmmm, slanty.
Marge Simpson: Patty, Selma. What are you doing here?
Patty Bouvier: Oh, we thought we'd stop by unexpectedly for dinner.
(Tent: Int. tent)
Selma Bouvier: Now bring us some extra chairs, like a good blubber-in-law!
Homer Simpson: Time to fertilize the lawn. A couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.
Marge Simpson: Homer, be careful with my sisters' heads. Their necks are brittle.
Patty Bouvier: That's okay, Marge, nothing's broke.
Patty Bouvier: Except Homer.
Marge Simpson: What's that supposed to mean?
Patty Bouvier: It means...
Homer Simpson: It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
Selma Bouvier: Now there's a stink I coulda done without.
(Simpson Living Room: INT. - SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - LATER)
Marge Simpson: This has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. I'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, Montreal Morn.
Homer Simpson: All right, you had your fun. Now get lost.
Patty Bouvier: Oh, our fun hasn't begun yet.
Homer Simpson: (YOKEL GRUNT) Hunh?
Selma Bouvier: We know something you don't want Marge to know. Now we own you like Siegfried owns Roy.
Marge Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) I'm sorry. All we have is Nescafe. I'm very, very sorry.
Patty Bouvier: Oh Marge, Marge. You're just in time. Homer's getting ready to give us a foot rub.
Marge Simpson: You are?
Homer Simpson: No! (SPIRIT BREAKS) I'm giving them a foot massage. (SOTTO TO PATTY) At least let me have that.
Patty Bouvier: You can start with the corns.
Selma Bouvier: Then you can move on to bunion country.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - corridor)
Bart Simpson: Okay, steady Bart. Taking ballet doesn't make you any less of a man.
Ballet Teacher: (RUSSIAN ACCENT) All right, girls. Today we learn the dance of the fairy queens. You can either be a fairy or a queen, it's wide open.
Bart Simpson: (SICK WHIMPER)
Ballet Teacher: Ah, and what have we here? A young man, maybe, who thinks he can be the next Baryshnikov?
Bart Simpson: I don't want to be the next anything. I'm only taking this stupid class because they made me.
Patty Bouvier: Well good. Jump, Homer, jump.
Opponent #3: Check mate.
Ballet Teacher: So, he has fire in the belly. But it will take more than belly-fire to be the next Baryshnikov!
Bart Simpson: Look, Boris. I think ballet's for sissies.
Ballet Teacher: (LAUGHS) Ballet is for the strong, the fierce, the determined. But for the sissies? Never. Now put on this fuchsiatard. You are a fairy.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. - NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - EVENING)
Lenny Leonard: Quittin' time!
Carl Carlson: Let's go, Homer. On the way home, we're all stopping at Moe's for a Zima.

Carl Carlson: Homer, quit wallowing in self-pity. Pull yourself together and come get drunk with us.
(Ballet Class: INT. - BALLET CLASS)
Ballet Teacher: Is something wrong, Mr. Simpson?
Bart Simpson: I don't like wearing tights, ma'am.
Ballet Teacher: But so many of your heroes wear tights. Batman, for example. And Magellan.
Bart Simpson: Look, I don't like this cootie platoon and I never will. I'm outta here and I'm out of this stupid outfit. (VARIOUS GRUNTS)
Bart Simpson: Wait! (BAFFLED) Joy of movement increasing... Love of dance, impossible to resist... Toes twinkling... Look at me, girls. I'm doing ballet...and I love it!
(Simpson Living Room: INT. - SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT)
Patty Bouvier: Am I wrong, or did it just get fatter in here?
Homer Simpson: Request permission to slink by.
Patty Bouvier: Permission pending. First, light our cigarettes.
Homer Simpson: But you're already smoking cig...
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY FURIOUS) You're really pushing it.
Selma Bouvier: C'mon, Homer. You can't spell obsequious without "IOU."
Homer Simpson: I'll have to trust you on that.
Patty Bouvier: Well, Marge was always a good speller. Let's ask her.
Homer Simpson: (HORRIFIED) No! Don't tell Marge! I'll be good. I'll be good!
Patty Bouvier: (PULLING THE IOU OUT OF REACH) Ah-ah-ah-ah! Just for that you have to crawl around on the floor like the dog you are.
Homer Simpson: But... (DEFEATED) Yes, ma'am.
Patty Bouvier: (LAUGHS) Now say "I am Homer Simpson, the lowly dog." In a dog voice.
Marge Simpson: What's going on in here?
Homer Simpson: (DOG VOICE) Rabsolutely rothing, Rarge.
Marge Simpson: What's that paper?
Homer Simpson: What paper?
Marge Simpson: (GASP) Homer, is this projection accurate? Did you borrow money from my sisters?
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY) I don't know Marge, I can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings.

(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - a moment later)
Homer Simpson: Sorry Marge. (GIVES HER KISS)
Homer Simpson: I never want to see you again! You either!
Marge Simpson: Homer, Homer why didn't you tell me?
Homer Simpson: (VERY DOWN) I was ashamed, Marge. I failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, I was a B-plus dog. I'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight.
(Simpson Kitchen: INT. - SIMPSON KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: How's Dad, today?
Marge Simpson: Not too good, Lisa. Frankly, he's underneath the table.
Homer Simpson: Nobody make me any breakfast. A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.
Marge Simpson: But I like to make you breakfast.
Homer Simpson: (SADLY) In that case, I'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. (RESOLUTELY) But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it. (BEAT) Maybe a little powdered sugar.
(Ballet Class: INT. BALLET CLASS)
Bart Simpson: See that? I started to do like a little arabesque, but then I just fully went for it and pulled off the demi-entrechant. (SUDDENLY GRUFF) Not that I'm into that kind of thing.
Ballet Teacher: Bravissimo, Bart. Next week, class gives its first recital. And you... you will dance the male lead.
Bart Simpson: Dance in front of my whole school? (ANNOYED) What is it with you and ballet?
Ballet Teacher: I know you have great conflict, Bart. You love ballet, yet you fear the boys will laugh at you. No?
Bart Simpson: No, I fear the girls will laugh at me. I fear the boys will beat the living snot out of me.
(Simpson Living Room: INT. - SIMPSON living room - NIGHT)
Lisa Simpson: Hey Dad, whatcha doing?
Homer Simpson: What was that -- national anthem?
Homer Simpson: Daddy has very important work to do. He's looking through the Want Ads to find a part-time job.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival.
Homer Simpson: Oh, no wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest sex machine.
Homer Simpson: (GROANS) I'll never pay off that debt.
Narrator: Need money fast? Got no experience? Step up to elegance. Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.
Homer Simpson: That's it! I'll make money with a chauffeur job. Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: I didn't turn it on. I thought you turned it on.
Homer Simpson: No. Well anyway, turn it off.

Seymour Skinner: Mm hm. We even bussed in troublemakers from other schools.
Bart Simpson: (GULPS)
Lisa Simpson: That spikey-haired masked dancer is really something. I wonder who he is.
Jimbo Jones: He's graceful yet masculine. So it's okay for me to enjoy this.
Nelson Muntz: This reminds me of the movie "Fame" and to a lesser extent the TV series, which was also called "Fame."
(Limousine: Int. Limousine)
Homer Simpson: Oh wow! I can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend, Mel Brooks! I love that movie, "Young Frankenstein". ...Scared the Hell out of me.
Mel Brooks: Uhm, thanks.
Homer Simpson: Hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. I'll be that Carl Reiner guy, you be what's his face.
Mel Brooks: (LAUGHS) Homer, it's not that easy. It takes the genius of Carl Reiner and the rhythm and timing that only he and I...
Homer Simpson: Sir, today every country has a national anthem. Did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?
Mel Brooks: (INSTANTLY INTO CHARACTER) Sure, sure we had. Of course, we was caves, but every cave had a national anthem. I'll never forget my cave's national anthem.
Bart Simpson: Dang.
Mel Brooks: (SINGS) LET 'EM ALL GO TO HELL, EXCEPT CAVE SEVENTY-SIX...
Mel Brooks: What's with the si... what's with the siren?
Chief Wiggum: Evening Simpson... You got a short in your taillight. It started blinkin' when you made that turn. Let's see your chauffeur's license.
Homer Simpson: (OILY) Chauffeur's license, eh? (YELLING TO MEL) Mel, buckle your borscht belt!
Chief Wiggum: Ah, since you're trying to make a getaway in park, I'm guessing you don't have a license. Better head down to the DMV. These two broads'll help you out.
Mel Brooks: Well. Officer, uh, this man is making me a little edgy. Could you please give me a ride to the airport?
Chief Wiggum: Well, hey, hey! You're Mel Brooks! (LAUGHS) Sure I'll give you a ride.
Mel Brooks: Thank you.
Chief Wiggum: Uh, on the way, we can do that two thousand dollar man thing.
Mel Brooks: (MOAN)

Kearney Zzyzwicz: (TAUNTING) He dances like girls!
Nelson Muntz: Haw-haw!

Seymour Skinner: I'm telling you people the earth revolves around the sun.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I am so proud of you. You showed a sensitive side of yourself that can never be erased. From this day forward we are kindred spirits.
Bart Simpson: Why did she just leave me here when I clearly need medical attention?
(Department of Motor Vehicles: INT. DMV - DAY)
Homer Simpson: Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV where stupid Patty and stupid Selma work. Sometimes I think God is teasing me, just like he teased Moses in the desert.
Marge Simpson: "Tested," Homer, God tested Moses. And try to be nice to my sisters. It's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time.
Homer Simpson: Oh, okay Marge, I'll get along with them. Then I will hug some snakes! Yes, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. (TO HIMSELF) Now that's sarcasm.

Selma Bouvier: Failed to check blind spot, minus two points.

Homer Simpson: (GROANS)
Patty Bouvier: Ohhh, oh boy. Oh that felt good.
Selma Bouvier: Let me try. Let me try. (STAMPS ANOTHER "FAIL") Oh yeah, oh boy. Oh that was so sweet.
Marge Simpson: So Homer, how'd you do?
Homer Simpson: (SADLY) Well, I...
Kent Brockman: That's according to a national survey ranking Springfield as the least popular city in America.
Grampa Simpson: Burn him!
Supervisor: Ladies. Please don't tell me you're smoking in a government building. Because that is precisely the kind of infraction that can cost a couple of sisters their promotion.
Selma Bouvier: (GENERAL FUMFERRING) Well uh, we....
Selma Bouvier: uh... she uh... (ETC.)
Homer Simpson: I'll never forgive myself for this.
Supervisor: (TAKEN ABACK) Wait a minute, those are yours, sir?
Homer Simpson: Yes. (COUGHS) I am in flavor country.
Supervisor: Both of them?
Homer Simpson: It's a big country.
Supervisor: Ladies, I apologize. And you, sir, are worse than Hitler.

Homer Simpson: Please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides.
Marge Simpson: That's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
Homer Simpson: I didn't do it for them. I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you. Please ask me to kill for you.
Marge Simpson: No, Homie. (TO PATTY AND SELMA) You see. You see, this is the stuff I've been telling you about that you never see.
Patty Bouvier: Homer, we're... sorry.
Selma Bouvier: If there's anything we can do to make it up...

Bart Simpson: I may be just a boy, but I have an idea. If I may, I'd like to show you a few slides.
Bart Simpson: Here's Springfield as it appears from space. Somewhere in this windy valley is the Lost Dutchman's Mine.

Mayor Joe Quimby: The old person's remarks will be stricken from the record.
Grampa Simpson: Who said that?
Marge Simpson: But my new idea is different. I think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes.

Rainier Wolfcastle: The film is just me in front of a brick wall for an hour and a half. It cost Eighty million dollars.
Jay: How do you sleep at night?
Rainier Wolfcastle: On top of a pile of money, with many beautiful ladies.
Jay: (CHIPPER) Just asking. (TO CAMERA) Yeesh.

C. Montgomery Burns: I ought to club them and eat their bones!
Waylon Smithers: Heh-heh. Well maybe this film festival could help us. A film biography might let them get to know the real you -- virtuous, heroic, nubile...
C. Montgomery Burns: You left out pleasant!
C. Montgomery Burns: But I like that film biography idea. A slick Hollywood picture to gloss over my evil rise to power, like "Bugsy," or "Working Girl." Get me Steven Spielberg!

Homer Simpson: It's just you and me now, lock of hair...
Marge Simpson: You don't have to do this.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, well you think I'm stupid.
Marge Simpson: I don't think you're stupid.
Homer Simpson: Prove it.

Homer Simpson: But ... The ball... His groin!...(LAUGHS) It works on so many levels! (LAUGHS) Roll it again.
Barney Gumble: Next, they're gonna show my movie.
Bart Simpson: You made a movie?
Barney Gumble: I made a movie? No wonder I was on the cover of "Entertainment Weekly."
Barney Gumble: My name is Barney Gumbel. I'm forty, I'm single, and I drink.
(Moe's Tavern: ext. moe's - day)
Barney Gumble: There's a line in "Othello" about a drinker -- "now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast." That pretty well covers it.
Woman: It's brilliant. Savagely honest, tender -- he has the soul of a poet.
Barney Gumble: (TURNING TO HER) You're very kind.
Woman: (DISGUSTED) Excuse me did something crawl down your throat and die?
Barney Gumble: It didn't die.
Barney Gumble: My name is Barney and I'm an alcoholic.
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Gumbel, this is a Girl Scout meeting.
Barney Gumble: Is it? Or is it that you girls can't admit you have a problem?
(Barney's Apartment: int. Barney's apartment - day)
Barney Gumble: Don't cry for me. I'm already dead.
Marge Simpson: (NOSE BLOWING NOISE)

(COMMITTEE ROOM: int. committee room - continuous)
Jay: (OUTRAGED) How can you vote for Burns' movie?
Krusty the Clown: (QUIETLY) Let's just say, it moved me. (LOUDLY) To a bigger house. (TO SELF) Oops. I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet. Oh, oh dear.
Jay: Two to two. Well, Homer, it all comes down to you.
Homer Simpson: Football in the groin. Football in the groin.
Jay: (SADLY) Well, we're not gonna resolve this deadlock any time soon.
Marge Simpson: Why don't we all take a five minute break? It'll clear our heads.
Homer Simpson: Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute.
(Hotel Hallway: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY)
Marge Simpson: I knew this would happen. I put you on the jury and you vote for the stupidest film.
Fortune Teller: I've been waiting for you... Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: (GASP) How did you know my name?
Homer Simpson: I have every right to be on that jury even though I got there because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
Jay: (PASSING BY) How many times have I heard Rex Reed say that?
Homer Simpson: Oh great, now you're going to make fun of me.
Jay: No, Homer, I won't make fun of you. But I will suggest that there may be better things in life than seeing a man get hit in the groin with a football.
Nelson Muntz: Haw haw.
Marge Simpson: Well, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do.
Homer Simpson: Hm. Barney's movie has heart. But football in the groin had a football in the groin.
Barney Gumble: Don't cry for me. I'm already dead.
Homer Simpson: Wow. I'll never drink another beer.

FORTUNE-TELLER: Your name tag.
Homer Simpson: Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's Beer Nuts. (LAUGHS) (FORGETTING) Mmm... Beer Nuts.
Homer Simpson: (SHORT SCREAM, ANNOYED GRUNT)

Bart Simpson: Oh, these Renaissance Faires are so boring.
Marge Simpson: (COYLY) Oh really? Did you see the loom? I took Loom in High School. (HUMS)
Bart Simpson: Meh.
Lunchlady Doris: Yon meat 'tis sweet as summer's wafting breeze.

Homer Simpson: (PASSIONATELY) Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I mightst sup on suckling pig this noon.
Lunchlady Doris: Whatever.
Homer Simpson: (ECSTATIC) I've eaten eight different meats. I'm a true Renaissance man.
Lisa Simpson: I'll go to the first aid tent and tell them to plug in ye olde stomach pump.

Lisa Simpson: Here bunny bunny! Here bunny!
Chief Wiggum: (CORRECTING) Here, esquilax.
FORTUNE-TELLER: (EERILY) Would you like to know your future?
Lisa Simpson: (PATRONIZING) Sorry, I don't believe in fortune telling. I should go.
FORTUNE-TELLER: What's your hurry? Bart, Maggie, and Marge are at the joust, and Homer is heckling the puppet show.
Lisa Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Wow, you can see into the... present.
Fortune Teller: Now we'll see what the future holds...
Lisa Simpson: (SWALLOWS) The Death Card.
Fortune Teller: No, that's good. It means transition, change.
Lisa Simpson: (TICKLED) Oh, that's cute.
Fortune Teller: (GASP) The Happy Squirrel.
Lisa Simpson: That's bad?
Fortune Teller: Possibly. The cards are vague and mysterious... They seem to be revealing the story of your first love. (BEAT) Do you want me to continue?
Lisa Simpson: (GULP) Guess so.
FORTUNE-TELLER: It's - it's coming to me. Yes, I see an Eastern university in the year two thousand ten. The world has become a very different place...
Student In Jeans: I can't wait to see that play.
(Library: Int. library - water fountain)
Lisa Simpson: Hey, watch it! / Watch it!
Lisa Simpson: That man is instantly the most annoying person I've ever met. (FRUSTRATED SOUND) A soy-based snack will calm me down.
Lisa Simpson: Aaagh. Him again.
Lisa Simpson: Hello. I need Ecosystem of the Marsh, by Thompson.
Librarian: The last copy was just signed out by (CHECKING LIST) ...Oh, Hugh Parkfield. Oh, there he is.
Lisa Simpson: No. It couldn't be...
Lisa Simpson: (RELIEVED SIGH)
HUGH: (TO MOUSTACHE MAN) Thanks for holding my book while I tied my shoe.
Lisa Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) That's the book I need. You'll probably take forever with it too.
HUGH: (SCOFFS) I can read faster than you.
Lisa Simpson: (COCKY) I read at a 78th grade level.
HUGH: (CHALLENGING) Right here.
Lisa Simpson: (QUICKLY) Finished this page?
HUGH: Ages ago.
Lisa Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUMBLE)
HUGH: I'll get the dictionary.
Lisa Simpson: Why?
HUGH: You'll see when you get there. The word "stochastic."
Lisa Simpson: "Pertaining to a process involving a randomly determined sequence of observations." (SCOFFS)
Librarian: First they hate each other. Now, all of a sudden, they love each other. Oh it doesn't make any sense to me.
Moustached Man: Of course not, you're a robot.
HUGH: Hmm... I've never met anyone who so understood the magic of Jim Carrey.
Lisa Simpson: (ADMIRINGLY) He can make you laugh with no more than a frantic flailing of his limbs.
(Lisa's Dorm: ext. lisa's dorm - establishing)
(DORM ROOM: Int. dorm room - months later)
HUGH: (SIGHS) I can't believe how much we have in common. We're both studying the environment, we're both utterly humorless about our vegetarianism, and we both love the Rolling Stones.
Lisa Simpson: Yes, not for their music, but for their tireless efforts to preserve historic buildings.
HUGH: Lisa, I can't bear the thought of being apart from you all summer. Come back with me to Parkfield Manor.
Lisa Simpson: I'd love to. Can we get vegetarian meals at your parents' house?
HUGH: (SERIOUS) Yes we can, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: (SERIOUS) That is good because eating animals is wrong.
HUGH: So very wrong.
Lisa Simpson: When will the world learn?
HUGH: I don't know. I just don't know.

Mrs. Parkfield: Thank you, Lisa. They were made for the finest family in Britain.
Mr. Parkfield: (WRYLY) I don't know how we ended up with them.
Mr. Parkfield: Oh, it's good to hear a boisterous American laugh.
Lisa Simpson: (LOOKING AT PORTRAIT) And I love that painting. Judging by the clothes, I'd say seventeenth century.
Mrs. Parkfield: Actually, Lisa, it's just uncle Eldred.
Eldred: (BRIGHTLY, TO LISA) I get me brain medicines from the National 'Ealth.
(MEADOW: ext. meadow)
Lisa Simpson: This place is so enchanting, Hugh. I love it here.
HUGH: I wanted this to be perfect for you. I know you Americans like everything to be fireworks.
HUGH: Oh blast!
HUGH: Go to "Plan B."
Lisa Simpson: (MOVED) Yes, I will.
Stablehand: Isn't it wonderful? Master Hugh has found a true love.
(PARKFIELD MANOR: Int. Parkfield manor - bedroom - later)
Lisa Simpson: Hi Mom.
Marge Simpson: Lisa!! Hello! How're you doing in England? Remember, an elevator is called a "lift," a mile is called a "kilometer," and botulism is called "steak and kidney pie."
Lisa Simpson: Guess what -- Hugh and I are getting married.
Marge Simpson: (YELLING) ALL RIGHT!!! Lisa, that's wonderful. If only your father was still with us... but he left for work a few minutes ago.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, remember when I was little, we'd always plan my dream wedding and you always promised to, you know, well, keep Dad from ruining it?
Marge Simpson: Oh, don't worry, honey. I guarantee your father will behave.
Lisa Simpson: (RE: FINGERS) Mom, it's a picture phone.
Marge Simpson: (CAUGHT, RE: FINGERS, THEN LYING) This? This? No, I - I've just got a touch of the rheumatiz.
Lisa Simpson: Oh.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, picture phone.
(Skyscraper: Ext. skyscraper - establishing)
Bart Simpson: Hi, Mom. Aw, that's great news about Lisa. Well listen, I'd better get to get back to work. (HANGS UP)

Milhouse Van Houten: Hey, hey there with the personal calls Simpson.
Homer Simpson: Oh, ah, but Mr. Milhouse, my little girl's getting married!
Milhouse Van Houten: Lisa? (SADLY) My one true love.
Lisa Simpson: It's not you, Milhouse. I just don't plan to ever get married.
Milhouse Van Houten: (TO HOMER) I think I'll write your performance evaluation now, Simpson.
(Simpson Neighborhood: Ext. Simpsons' block - establishing)
(Simpsons: Int. Simpsons - kitchen)
Homer Simpson: Oh, I gotta call everyone and tell 'em the good news.
Homer Simpson: (FRUSTRATED NOISE; YELLING UPSTAIRS) Maggie! I need to use the phone!
(Maggie's Bedroom: Int. Maggie's room - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Will that girl ever shut up? Okay, Marge. I'll plan everything. We can have the reception at Moe's. Wait, why not have the whole wedding there? We'll do it on a Monday morning -- there'll be fewer drunks.
Marge Simpson: Homer, don't take this personally, but I've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding.
Homer Simpson: Well, these seem to be in order. I'll be out back in the hammock.
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Smithers plus guest. There's only one person I would want to bring.
Waylon Smithers: Oh, Mr. Burns, we'll thaw you out the second they discover the cure for seventeen stab wounds in the back.
Waylon Smithers: How're we doing, boys?
Professor Jonathan Frink: Well, we're up to fifteen!
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. Springfield elementary - miss Hoover's classroom)

Girl: Pepsi?
Troy McClure: Partial credit.
Seymour Skinner: (SHOWING INVITE) We've been invited to the wedding of our only graduate to read at an adult level.
Miss Hoover: Hmm, it must be Lisa Simpson, because of course Martin Prince perished in that science fair explosion.
Martin Prince: Not quite perished, my lady love. Although some days, I wish I had.
(Springfield Street: Ext. Springfield street - a month later)
(OTTO CAB: Int. Otto cab)
Lisa Simpson: Hey, I remember you. Mayor Quimby, right?

Mayor Joe Quimby: (BITTERLY TO SELF) I cut the ribbon at that convention center.
(Springfield Street: Ext. Springfield street)
Lisa Simpson: (NERVOUS LAUGHS) Just a couple more blocks to my house.
HUGH: Oh Lisa, please. The only thing bruised in that fall was my spine. (TO HOMER) I'll be delighted.
(Simpson Car: Int. simpson car - later)
HUGH: Lisa, darling, don't worry. I'm sure I'll get along with your family. You've so thoroughly prepared me for the worst, as long as they're not squatting in a ditch poking berries up their noses...
Lisa Simpson: And if they are?
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson House - front yard)
Bart Simpson: Here they come! Raise the flag!
Marge Simpson: (EXCITED) Oh Lisa!
Homer Simpson: Yo, Hugh. Here's a little bit of U.S. hospitality. What do you think of that?
Lisa Simpson: (POINTING AT FLAG) Dad!
Marge Simpson: Now throw compost on it!
Homer Simpson: Whew! (SHEEPISH) Uh, enjoy.
HUGH: Oh, still warm.
Homer Simpson: You can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom I built. (QUIETLY) Remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box.
(New Bedroom: Int. new bedroom)
Lisa Simpson: Oh Hugh, thank you. You've been just wonderful through this entire ordeal.
HUGH: Lisa, I love you so much I'm willing to go through anything.
Lisa Simpson: (GASP) Are you okay?
HUGH: I'm fine, Lisa. Fortunately, the compost heap broke my fall. Be a dear, run a bath.
(Simpson Dining Room: Int. Simpsons dining room - later)
Marge Simpson: (QUIETLY) Homer! Bart! Maggie! Company eating rules.
Homer Simpson: (BURP) Oh, right.
Bart Simpson: Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. I also crush cars into cubes. And on the side, I promote local tough man contests. Basically I'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til I go to law school.
Homer Simpson: So, Hugh. Have you heard all the latest American jokes? Uh, here's a good one. Pull my finger.
HUGH: (CHUCKLES POLITELY) Yes, we have that one in England too, Mr. Simpson.
Homer Simpson: (THREATENING) I said, pull my finger.
Lisa Simpson: (CHANGING SUBJECT) Uh, Mom, we've got my wedding dress fitting this afternoon. Maggie, if you're not doing anything, why don't you come with us?
Marge Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Maggie! Don't talk with your mouth full.
Homer Simpson: Me and Bart'll take Hugh out on the town this afternoon.
Lisa Simpson: Hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
Homer Simpson: Great. There's only one thing I ask in return.
Homer Simpson: (YELLING ABOVE HORNS) So this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh Hugh?
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's)

HUGH: You know, I rather like this pub.
Moe Szyslak: (POURING) Oh, an English boy, eh? You know we saved your ass in World War Two.
HUGH: Yeah, well, we saved your ass in World War Three.
Moe Szyslak: That's true.
Homer Simpson: Hugh, there's something I want you to have. My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge, and they brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage. We don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive.
HUGH: (MOVED) Well I'd be honored...
HUGH: (FINISHING WITH LESS ENTHUSIASM) ...to wear... those... things.
Bart Simpson: Ow! Hey watch those virtual darts. I'm trying to play virtual pool!
Other Player: Ow!
Moe Szyslak: Hey, hey, no fightin' in my bar.
(Simpsons: Int. Simpsons - bedroom - night)
Marge Simpson: You know, Fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually, I didn't even notice.
Homer Simpson: Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again. (LISTENS CONTENTEDLY)
Homer Simpson: Keep it down in there!
(Lisa's Bedroom: Int. Lisa's bedroom - continuous)
Lisa Simpson: All right, Dad! (QUIETLY) I'm sorry I left you alone with Homer and Bart.

Lisa Simpson: How did you get that gash on your forehead?
HUGH: Oh, that was when we hid in the dumpster after the fire alarm went off in the pornographic magazine warehouse.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, you are so good to put up with all of this.
HUGH: Don't be silly, Lisa. Everything's fine. Really. Now, go to sleep. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow. A big, long day.
(Simpsons: Int. Simpsons - Lisa's OLD room - morning)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, I can't believe it's your wedding day already.

Lisa Simpson: Okay, I've got something old - that's my pearl necklace. Something new is the wedding dress. Something borrowed is this antique brooch from Hugh's mother. Now I just need something blue.
Marge Simpson: Here.
Lisa Simpson: Oh Mom. Thanks.
(SPRINGFIELD MEADOW: Ext. Springfield meadow - day)
(BRIDE'S TENT: Int. bride's tent)
Bart Simpson: Wow, Lisa. Looking at you makes me want to get married for a third time. I met a really nice exotic dancer the other night at Hugh's bachelor party.
Lisa Simpson: Hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
Bart Simpson: We had one in his honor. (OFF HER LOOK) I had one in his honor. (THEN) I went to a strip club.
(MAIN TENT: Int. main tent - simultaneous)
HUGH: Well, here goes nothing. (DEEP BREATH) Mom, Dad, meet Homer Simpson.
Homer Simpson: Hey, how are you. Nice to meet ya.
Homer Simpson: You know what's great about you English? "Octopussy." Man, I must have seen that movie... twice.
HUGH: (BURSTING WITH GREAT RELIEF) Yes, yes. That's not too bad!
Patty Bouvier: Hey, Krabappel, you get in the way of that bouquet, I'll stuff that sun hat down your neck!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, take me home. I'm not fully defrosted.

(Lisa's Tent: Int. Lisa's tent)
Homer Simpson: Ooh la la.
Lisa Simpson: Hi, Dad.
Homer Simpson: You look great, sweetheart.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks.
Homer Simpson: (HE TAKES HER HANDS IN HIS) Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson. You know, I always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. Since the time you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me.
Lisa Simpson: Oh Dad...
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: And now, to sing "Amazing Grace," Miss Maggie Simpson.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (CHUCKLES) She's quite a hellion, but she does have an incredible voice.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - dining room)
Homer Simpson: No, no, let me finish. I just want you to know I've always been proud of you. You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself. You helped me understand my own wife better and taught me to be a better person. But you're also my daughter, and I don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you--
Lisa Simpson: (SWEETLY) Dad, you're babbling.
Homer Simpson: See? You're still helping me.
Lisa Simpson: Hey, Dad. Did you forget to give those cufflinks to Hugh?
Homer Simpson: (EMBARRASSED) Aw, no...
Lisa Simpson: Well?
Homer Simpson: I found them on the night stand this morning. (COVERING HURT FEELINGS) I guess they weren't his cup of tea. Don't worry about it.
Lisa Simpson: But you've been going on about these all week. I'm sure he just forgot.
(GROOM'S TENT: Int. groom's tent)
HUGH: Lisa! We're not supposed to see each other before the wedding. It's tradition.
Lisa Simpson: (GENTLY) What about my family's tradition?
HUGH: Surely you don't want me to wear those. In front of my parents and their friends?
Lisa Simpson: But you promised my Dad you would.
HUGH: I was just humoring him, darling. Actually, he frightens me a bit.
Lisa Simpson: I know they look a little silly, but his feelings will be hurt if you don't wear them.
HUGH: (ANNOYED) Fine. (HE STARTS PUTTING THEM ON) I must say, you were right. This has been quite trying. You know I've attempted to enjoy your family on a personal level, on an ironic level, as a novelty, as camp, as kitsch, as a cautionary example, nothing works. Frankly, I'll be quite relieved when we get back to England and we won't have to deal with them.
Lisa Simpson: (HURT) Are you saying we won't see my family again?
HUGH: Well, possibly your mother will come when the children are born.
Lisa Simpson: I can't believe I'm hearing this. I don't want to cut my family out of my life.
HUGH: Really? But Lisa, you're better than this place. You're like a flower that grew out of a pot of dirt.
Lisa Simpson: That's a horrible thing to say.
HUGH: Oh come on, you complain about them more than anyone.
Lisa Simpson: Maybe. But I still love them. And I don't think you understand that.
(MAIN TENT: Ext. main tent)
HUGH: (DISTRAUGHT) Stop everything. The wedding has been called off.
Adult Nelson: Haw haw.
NELSON JR.: Haw haw.
Aged Krusty: (GROAN)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Aw, this is very sad news... and it never would have happened if the wedding had been inside the church with God, instead of out here in the cheap showiness of nature.
Lunchlady Doris: Who wants cake?
Fortune Teller: ...the next day, Hugh goes back to England and you never see him again.
Lisa Simpson: Wow. Now that I know all this, isn't there any way to change the future?
Fortune Teller: No. But try to look surprised.
Lisa Simpson: (DOWNBEAT) I thought you said you'd tell me about my true love?

Homer Simpson: Lisa, Lisa! Where were you!? You missed the most incredible thing!
Lisa Simpson: Hi, Dad.
Homer Simpson: I ate seven pounds of fudge!
Lisa Simpson: Wow!
Homer Simpson: The man at the stand said it was a record!
Lisa Simpson: Wow. What else did you do, Dad?
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED) I rode the teacups! Then I got a little sick and I had to sit down. But then I rode 'em again!
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - evening)
Kent Brockman: (TO CAMERA) Welcome to the six o'clock news in our brand new studio! (TO CROWD) Lookin' good, Springfield!!
Kent Brockman: In today's news, a two ton rhino escaped from the Springfield Zoo. But zoo officials were quick to act and Petunia, as she is known, is safely back in captivity.
Kent Brockman: In other news, a three ton rhino that escaped from the zoo last week is still at large.
Marge Simpson: All right, who broke my vase?!
Lisa Simpson: Who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them up?!
Homer Simpson: Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?
Bart Simpson: (INSULTED) Oh, please! This is senseless destruction, with none of my usual social commentary.
Lisa Simpson: If it wasn't you, then who was it?
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?
Homer Simpson: (SCARED) Did they?!
Homer Simpson: Hmm, I guess Bart's not to blame. He's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and I've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'.
(Simpson Backyard: ext. simpson backyard - a few minutes later)
Bart Simpson: I don't know why you're so energetic today, boy, but prepare to be worn out.
Lisa Simpson: What's wrong, boy? Getting tired?
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - the next morning)
Marge Simpson: I think there's really something wrong with Santa's Little Helper. He was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever.
Lisa Simpson: (GASP) My Bongo drums!
Bart Simpson: My strobe light!
Homer Simpson: My "Best of Ray Stevens featuring The Streak" album! So it was the dog that buried all our stuff!
Marge Simpson: (EYES DARTING) Yes, the dog...
Homer Simpson: Oh my God! He's got the precious cable TV cable!
(Chief Wiggum's Bedroom: int. chief wiggum's bedroom - continuous action)
Kent Brockman: Always use fresh macaroni. If the box rattles, throw it away...
Chief Wiggum: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Cable Announcer: Your cable TV is experiencing difficulties. Please do not panic. Resist the temptation to read or talk to loved ones. Do not attempt sexual relations, as years of TV radiation have left your genitals withered and useless.
Chief Wiggum: (LOOKING DOWN) Well, I'll be damned.
(Pet Store: ext. pet store - the next day)
Marge Simpson: Excuse me, we're having a problem with our dog...
Pet Store Man: Lady, I'll tell you what I'm telling everyone else. I'm sorry if your dog went blind, but your gripe is with Hartz Mountain, not with me.
Marge Simpson: No, no, our dog is out of control. He's wild, destructive, and has little or no respect for authority.
Pet Store Man: Hmm... let me try a canine/human mind meld. It's an incredibly rare psychic power possessed only by me and three other clerks at this store.
Pet Store Man: Okay. (IN MIND MELD; SOMEWHAT TORTURED; BARKS) I'm bored... I'm restless... Need change in life... (BARK) Like imported leather leash... (BARK) Uh, blue contact lenses. (BARK) 200 volt shock training collar...

Homer Simpson: Don't worry. We'll catch him, or run him over tryin'.
(Street: ext. street - later)
Bart Simpson: Look, he's heading back to the greyhound racing track where we found him!
Homer Simpson: Don't worry. As soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. Believe me, I know.
(DOG RACING TRACK LOBBY: INT. DOG RACING TRACK lobby - continuous action)
Marge Simpson: Oh, this place is so big. Do you think we should split up and look for them, Homie? Homie?
Homer Simpson: (TO MAN BEHIND WINDOW, QUIETLY) Two bucks to win on number eight... (OFF FAMILY'S GLARE)...and have you seen my beloved dog? (NERVOUS LAUGH; SOTTO) Gimme the ticket.
(Track: int. track - GRANDSTAND AREA - a short while later)
Homer Simpson: We can't lose. Look at the name of the dog I bet on. (SHOWS MARGE PROGRAM)
Marge Simpson: (READING) "She's The Fastest..." Homer, I don't think that means necessarily...
Track Announcer: And they're off! She's The Fastest jumps out to an insurmountable lead!
Homer Simpson: (GLOATING) You're lucky you got looks, Marge.
Track Announcer: As they round the far turn, it's She's The Fastest, followed by Always Comes In Second and I'm Number Three...
Homer Simpson: Yes! Come on, you little horse!
Track Announcer: And they're in the home stretch. It's -- wait! Another dog is on the track!
Bart Simpson: It's Santa's Little Helper!
Track Announcer: The mystery dog is gaining fast on the outside. Of course, he could never win this race - or could he?
Lisa Simpson: (CONFUSED) What's Santa's Little Helper doing to that dog?
Marge Simpson: Uh-oh...
Bart Simpson: (CONFUSED) It looks like he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite make it. Come on, boy, you can do it!
Track Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end. This is the end of dog racing.
Crowd: (GENERAL BOOING AND DISCONTENT)
Marge Simpson: I think they're in love.
Crowd: (SUDDENLY MOVED) Aww...
Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. He misses casual sex.
Lisa Simpson: Can we keep Santa's girlfriend, Mom?
Marge Simpson: But she's not our dog.
Texan: She's yours now!
Texan: Once they fall in love they lose their racin' spirit.
Marge Simpson: But won't you miss her loyalty and companionship?
Texan: (BIG LAUGH) Lady, you're allll-right!
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - a little later)
Marge Simpson: (OPENING DOOR) Okay, you can go out and play, but...(CONFIDENTIALLY) no more you know what in front of the house, all right?
Marge Simpson: (YELLING OUT DOOR) Hey, what did I just say?!!
Luigi: Take it, it fell on the floor-a.
Bart Simpson: Hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?
Bart Simpson: (MOANS) Me and Santa's Little Helper used to be a team, but he never wants to play anymore since his bitch moved in!
Marge Simpson: Bart! Don't ever say that word again!
Bart Simpson: Well that's what she is! I looked it up.
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm going to write the dictionary people and have that checked. It feels like a mistake to me.
Bart Simpson: Hey look! A really small dog just fell out of Santa's girlfriend.
Marge Simpson: (GASP) Oh, my God! She's having babies! (TO SHE'S THE FASTEST) Oh, I'm sorry, girl. I thought you were just getting fat.
Lisa Simpson: Look, it's twins!
Homer Simpson: Now it's two sets of twins.
Bart Simpson: Two sets of twins and a triplet!
Marge Simpson: Homer, Homer find a place for all these little miracles.
Marge Simpson: Oh, my. I've never seen anything like this.

Marge Simpson: Yeeesch! This house stinks! You're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?
Homer Simpson: (HUFFY) Do you have a better idea?
Marge Simpson: Now I know we love the puppies very much, but I think they're getting to be a problem.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, they ate all my socks! I have to wear Lisa's to school today!
Homer Simpson: How do you explain the culottes, boy?
Bart Simpson: Well, I have to coordinate, don't I?
Homer Simpson: Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies away.
Lisa Simpson: Nooooooo!
Homer Simpson: (QUICKLY) Mainly your mother.
Lisa Simpson: Is that what we do in this family? When someone becomes an inconvenience, we just get rid of them?!
(Springfield Retirement Castle: Int. Retirement castle)
Grampa Simpson: (HOPEFUL) Hello? Is anybody there? (SAD GROAN)
Marge Simpson: All right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. As long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. On a completely unrelated topic, I'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight.
Homer Simpson: Splendid. Who's coming?
Marge Simpson: Rev. Lovejoy, your old Army drill sergeant, and the Regional Director of the IRS.
(Simpson Dining Room: int. simpson dining room - that night)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Oh, just lovely, Marge. The whole town will hear what a perfect evening this was, how nothing at all went wrong.
Chief Wiggum: Don't worry folks, we'll find your wallet.
DRILL SGT.: (TO HOMER) Simpson, this evening has gone so flawlessly, I'm gonna forget that you were mistakenly let out of the Army a month early.
Irs Agent: And I'm so impressed by this problem-free evening that there's no need for that audit.
Irs Agent: A toast to the Simpsons...
DRILL SGT.: And to the delectable turkey...that's walking around the table??!!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Dear Lord, it's a demon bird!

(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - the next day)
Ned Flanders: Oh, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the Flanderosa.
Seymour Skinner: It'd be nice to have some companionship when mother goes out on dates.
Grampa Simpson: We could use a new pet over at the home seein' how we accidentally killed that smart-mouthed bird.
Lisa Simpson: They don't like being broken up.
Marge Simpson: We've got to be realistic, kids. Who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of twenty-five puppies?
C. Montgomery Burns: (LAUGHS) ...and I know the little fellas would love romping around my many acres, chasing my many cars, drinking from my many toilets...
Homer Simpson: (ENTHUSED) Who wouldn't?
Lisa Simpson: (SOTTO, TO MARGE) Mom, don't give the puppies to him! He'll be mean to them!
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR) She's right, Homer. There's something about his face I don't trust.
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED) Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but you can't have these dogs. (EYES CLOSED) Am I fired?
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmm? Oh, of course not. They're your pets, you can do as you wish. Good day, everyone.
Marge Simpson: My, he certainly took that well.
Homer Simpson: A little too well, if you ask me. I'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies.
C. Montgomery Burns: There you go. There you go. You too...
Waylon Smithers: Honestly, sir, you just don't put the effort into your schemes that you used to.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - the next morning)

Lisa Simpson: Let's go find your babies!
Marge Simpson: Dinner's on, dogs!
Chief Wiggum: (SADLY) I'm sorry, kids. I don't think we're ever gonna find your greyhounds. Maybe Mr. Burns will sell you one of the twenty-five he got last night.

Lisa Simpson: But they're ours! You stole them from us!
C. Montgomery Burns: (HANDS HER A CELLULAR PHONE) Here's a phone. Call somebody who cares.
C. Montgomery Burns: Give me that! Now if you'll excuse us, children, the pups have a date with a fashion knife.
Bart Simpson: There! Now you don't know which one is Little Monty! I guess if you don't want him to be part of your tuxedo, you'll have to let the other dogs go, too!
C. Montgomery Burns: Nice try. C'mon, Little Monty, stand up!
C. Montgomery Burns: Come on, stand up! Do your trick.
Lisa Simpson: No, don't! Stay down, Monty! Don't get up! Stay down! Stay down, boy! (ETC.)

C. Montgomery Burns: (TO CHILDREN) But I can kill you!
C. Montgomery Burns: No, I can't kill you either. Look at you standing there on your hind legs like a couple of Rory Calhouns.
Lisa Simpson: Well, Mr. Burns, I hope you've realized the folly of killing innocent animals for fashion.

Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Seymour, the children are playing in the hole again. Shouldn't you get that fixed?
Seymour Skinner: Edna, you know they just cut the school's budget. Besides, if I had the money, I'd fix the exhaust leak in the back. Frankly, I think it's causing some of our low test scores.

Tour Guide: Of course, for safety reasons, we don't keep the cannon loaded. It's just common sense.

Enemy Soldier #2: We're sick. We need leeches, and hack saws to saw off our gangrenous limbs!
Narrator: But the Springfield brigade was too brave to accept the surrender...
Soldier #1: Come on, boys! Those white flags are no match for our muskets!
Soldier #2: Charge!
Narrator: ... And the Springfielders heroically slaughtered their enemies as they prayed for mercy.

Bart Simpson: Ah, I think I got your lunch.

Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Seymour, the teachers are fed up. You have to start putting money back into the school. You've cut back on everything: salaries, supplies, the food. (TAKES A BITE) I don't care what you say, I can taste the newspaper.
Seymour Skinner: Posh. Shredded newspapers add much needed roughage and essential inks. Besides, you didn't notice the old gym mats.
(KITCHEN: Int. kitchen)
Lunchlady Doris: (SADLY) There's very little meat in these gym mats.
Seymour Skinner: That's it!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Our demands are very reasonable. By ignoring them, you're selling out these children's futures.
Seymour Skinner: (BLURTING) Oh, c'mon, Edna. We both know these children have no future.
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLES; COVERING) Prove me wrong, kids. Prove me wrong.
Lisa Simpson: I've never seen them fight like that, Bart. I'm worried that all this posturing and saber-rattling could lead to a teachers strike.
Bart Simpson: Strike, eh?
Bart Simpson: Oww! (SHAKING FINGERS) My bones are so brittle. But I always drink plenty of... (PICKS UP CARTON) malk? (RHYMES WITH "TALC")
(Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom: INT. Krabappel's classroom)

Seymour Skinner: It still points, doesn't it?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Stop that. And look at this. The only books we have are ones that were banned by other schools.
Seymour Skinner: Well, the kids have to learn about Tek War sooner or later.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Go away, Bart. This is not a good time.
Bart Simpson: I saw you two fighting. (FRIGHTENED LITTLE BOY) I'm worried there could be a strike and the school would shut down.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (LAUGHS; NOT BUYING IT) I'm sure you'd really hate that. There's not going to be a strike, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, Skinner said you wouldn't have the wontons to go through with it.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (GASPS) Skinner said that?
Bart Simpson: Well, I had to clean it up a little.
(Skinner's Office: Int. Skinner's office)
Bart Simpson: But basically, Krabappel said you'd give the teachers everything they want.
Seymour Skinner: She did?
Bart Simpson: Yeah. She said you'd fold faster than Superman on laundry day.
Seymour Skinner: We'll see about that. Simpson, I always thought you were sneaky and manipulative, but now I see you're really a very sensitive little boy.
Bart Simpson: (BATTING EYES) Thank you, sir.
Seymour Skinner: (MOVED) Aww.
(Hallway: INT. HALLWAY - later)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Seymour, you're being totally unfair and the teachers won't stand for it.

Opponent #1: Check mate.
Homer Simpson: Lousy teachers. Trying to palm off our kids on us.
Lisa Simpson: But Dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.
Lisa Simpson: I've got some textbooks, but without state approved syllabi and standardized testing my education can only go so far.
Marge Simpson: Honey, maybe you should relax a little?
Lisa Simpson: Relax? I can't relax. Nor can I yield, relent, or... (SCARED NOISE) Only two synonyms? Oh my God! I'm losing my perspicacity! (SCREAMS)
Homer Simpson: Well, it's always in the last place you look.
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. school - TWO WEEKS LATER)
Lisa Simpson: So if we were in school this week, what do you think we'd be learning?
Miss Hoover: Get away from me.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Good news, people!

(House: Ext. house)
Bart Simpson: (TO SELF) Now for operation strike-make-go-longer.
Bart Simpson: You know, I heard Skinner say the teachers will crack any minute.
Teacher: (TO KRABAPPEL) Skinner said the teachers will crack any minute purple monkey dishwasher.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well, we'll show him - especially for that purple monkey dishwasher remark.

Bart Simpson: Milhouse, I found a hive of killer bees. You wanna go throw rocks at it?
Milhouse Van Houten: (MUFFLED) Hey cool! There's a rabbit in here.
Milhouse Van Houten: Sorry Bart, I'm deeply immersed in the Teapot Dome Scandal.
Bart Simpson: Huh?
Milhouse Van Houten: However, it might be feasible in a fortnight.
Bart Simpson: Wuh?
Milhouse Van Houten: I can play in two weeks.
Bart Simpson: Juh?

(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Marge Simpson: I'm worried about the kids, Homie. Lisa's becoming very obsessive. This morning I caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat.
Homer Simpson: (SCOFFING) I know. And this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. It just keeps going faster and faster.
Marge Simpson: And Bart isn't doing very well either. He needs boundaries, and structure. There's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome.
Bart Simpson: (EERILY CALM) Hello, mother dear.
Marge Simpson: That's it. We have to get them back to school.
Homer Simpson: I'm with you, Marge. Lisa, get in here! (LISA POPS HER HEAD IN; THEN RE: PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE) In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics.
(Auditorium: Int. auditorium)
Ned Flanders: All right, I'd like to call this meeting of the PTA to or-diddly-order and let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss, huh? Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin?
Seymour Skinner: Boo!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Oh, boo yourself. Our demands are simple: a small cost of living increase and some better equipment and supplies for your children.
Parents: Yay! / That's reasonable. / Give it to 'em.
Seymour Skinner: Yeah, in a dream world. We have a very tight budget. To do what she's asking, we'd have to raise taxes.
Parents: Raise taxes! / They're too high as they are right now! / Taxes are bad. / We don't want that.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: It's your children's future.
Parents: That's true./ Children are important./ They're our future./ Best to plan.
Seymour Skinner: It'll cost you.
Parents: Oh right, taxes. / I forgot that. / I don't have any extra money. / They're gonna raise taxes. (ETC.)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: C'mon.
Parents: She makes a good case./ Good point / Sounds logical. (ETC.)
Parents: Oh right, the money. / That finger thing means taxes. / That means money./ I pay a lot of taxes.
Ned Flanders: Well, I guess this is a case where we'll have to agree to disagree.
Seymour Skinner: I don't agree to that.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Neither do I.
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLING) Oh, this is a dilly of a pickle.
Panicky Man: Oh my God! The PTA has disbanded! (GASPS)
Ned Flanders: No, no. The PTA has not disbanded.

Moe Szyslak: Hey, hey, what are you laughin' at? What? Oh, oh, I get it. I get it. It's my big ears, isn't it, kids? Isn't it? Well children, I can't help that!
Milhouse Van Houten: Wow Bart, I'm impressed the way you knocked off all those substitutes.
Bart Simpson: (SOLEMN) In my weaker moments I almost pity them. Then I just remind myself they're trying to teach.
Seymour Skinner: Well children, I don't know what you did to all those substitutes, but it's going to stop now. Leopold?
Leopold: All right, you listen up you little freaks. The fun stops here. You're gonna shut your stinkin' traps and behave, dammit. This is one substitute you're not gonna screw with...Marge Simpson.
Marge Simpson: Hello class. Hi Bart. Over here, sweetie. It's me, Mom. (WAVING) Hi. Hey. Hello.
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm sure some of you already know me. I'm Bart Simpson's mother.

(Simpson Dining Room: Int. simpson dining room - that evening)
Homer Simpson: So, how was everybody's day at school?
Bart Simpson: Horrifying.
Lisa Simpson: Pointless.
Marge Simpson: Exhausting. It took the children forty minutes to locate Canada on the map.
Homer Simpson: Marge, anyone can miss Canada... all tucked away down there.
Bart Simpson: Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test. Can I please go to the nurse?
Lisa Simpson: Well, my teacher's a nightmare. Three kids got sick from inhaling his ointment fumes, he confiscated everything made of tin, and then he sent us home early because he got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener.

Lisa Simpson: There's no way I'll get into an Ivy League school now. (SCORNFUL) At this rate I probably won't even get into Vassar.
Homer Simpson: (QUIET RAGE) Well, I've had just about enough of your Vassar bashing young lady.
Bart Simpson: Look Mom, it feels really weird having you on my turf. How would you feel if I started moppin' the floor?
Marge Simpson: I'd be thrilled. You can start right now.
Bart Simpson: (FOILED NOISE)
Marge Simpson: (FIRM) And I'm gonna keep teaching your class. Like it or lump it.
Bart Simpson: (HUFFY) Well, then. I guess I'll just have to get into the crawl space again.
Marge Simpson: I hate it when he gets in there.
(PLAYGROUND: Ext. playground - day)
Bart Simpson: Psst. Over here.
Bart Simpson: (HUMILIATED) Mom, I need a dollar. Ever since you started teaching here, kids have been taking my lunch money. And I need that money for candy.
Marge Simpson: Ah, here you go, precious. (GIVES HIM MONEY) Now go off with your friends.
DOLPH: (MOCKING) "Here ya go, precious."
Bart Simpson: Why isn't my mom stopping this?
DOLPH: We've created a diversion.
Marge Simpson: That's a very nice jig, Kearney. Now, isn't dancing much more fun than bullying?
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Yeah.
Bart Simpson: That's it. I can't take this anymore, Milhouse. I've gotta get the real teachers back.
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, you'll never get Krabappel and Skinner together again. They're like two positively charged ions.
Homer Simpson: (HAPPILY) Oh, this is wonderful! You're alive!
Bart Simpson: Zuh? Wait, that's it! With your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts, we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together.

Seymour Skinner: What's the point? There's no more money. Unless you've got some magic new source of revenue.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well, we've got to figure something out. They've got us locked in here like prisoners.

Krusty the Clown: (UNHAPPY LAUGH)

Marge Simpson: (IRRITATED GRUNT) Bart, are you ready for your history test?
Bart Simpson: Oh you bet, Mom. Ask me anything.

Homer Simpson: Really? Wow.
Marge Simpson: Bart, you said you were going to study.
Bart Simpson: (PAINED) Oh, my stomach!
Marge Simpson: You just don't want to take that test.
Bart Simpson: No I mean it. It really hurts!
Lisa Simpson: Mom, I think he's serious.

Bart Simpson: (READING) "No teacher shall be held accountable if Bart Simpson dies."

With their hippin' and the hoppin' and the bippin' and the boppin', so they don't know what the jazz is all about. You see, jazz is like a Jell-O Pudding Pop. No, actually it's more like Kodak film.

Lisa Simpson: But he was the only person who had the same love for music that I do. (SOB)
Lisa Simpson: Thank you. (TO HOMER) Oh Dad, why did he have to die?
Homer Simpson: Well, it's like the time that your cat, Snowball, got run over.
Lisa Simpson: Uh huh.
Homer Simpson: Remember, honey?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah.
Homer Simpson: What I'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman.

Marge Simpson: Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
Homer Simpson: (HA-RUMPH NOISE) They're butchering the classics. Could that bassoon have come in any more late?
Marge Simpson: Ah, c'mon, Homer, there's lasers. You like lasers.
Homer Simpson: Laser effects, mirrored balls. John Williams must be rolling around in his grave.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (LAUGHS) Devilishishly satirical. I wonder if anyone else got that?

Homer Simpson: Then how come that guy's winning?
Shill: (JAILBIRDESQUE VOICE) Whoa, I like totally won again.
Snake Jailbird: Way to go, bro.
Marge Simpson: (WHISPERING TO HOMER) He looks and acts just like the dealer. I think they're related or at least in cahoots.
Marge Simpson: (THRILLED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: (TO JAILBIRD) Twenty on this one, my good man.
Snake Jailbird: (FLIPPING A BLACK CARD) Sorry dude. Black.
Marge Simpson: Homer, he cheated you.
Crowd: Cheater. / Thief. / You're giving Three Card Monte a bad name.
Snake Jailbird: Surely you don't blame me.
Marge Simpson: It's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas. How dare you prey on the greedy and stupid, like this.

Chief Wiggum: (HELPFUL) We'll try to make it twelve.
Homer Simpson: (VERY CONCERNED; BREATHY GASPS) Marge, are you okay?
Marge Simpson: Ah, I think I'm okay. It was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating.
Homer Simpson: Yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman.
Marge Simpson: Oh for crying out loud...
Homer Simpson: Easy now, sweetheart. Homie's here.

Marge Simpson: Lisa, unhand your brother.
Lisa Simpson: (CHUCKLE)
Bart Simpson: (SCORNFUL) Yeah, like that really hurt.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, was catching that guy the most incredibly exciting thing you've ever done?
Marge Simpson: Well, it was pretty exciting, but (TRYING TO CONVINCE HERSELF) celery soup's pretty exciting too.
Marge Simpson: (BORED CHOPPING NOISES)

Homer Simpson: (YELLING) You did what?!!
(Simpson Master Bedroom: int. simpson bedroom - continuous)
Bart Simpson: I borrowed your nail clipper, what's the big deal?
Homer Simpson: Nothing. I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
Bart Simpson: (TO MARGE) Cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions?
Marge Simpson: You got it, little buddy.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. And I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.
Marge Simpson: Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. You'll always be the man of this house.
Homer Simpson: Aw, thanks, honey.
(Springfield Police Academy: EXT. SPRINGFIELD POLICE ACADEMY - DAY)

Homer Simpson: (HEARTFELT) Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there. You've become very dear to me.
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED) Oh, Homie, of course I will.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to throw yourself in front of him and take the bullet?
Marge Simpson: I suppose I would.
Bart Simpson: What if they shot at a coke machine?
Marge Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: TV?
Marge Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: TV with a picture of the mayor on it?

Chief Wiggum: Fitz and Garcia, it's your turn to sleep in.
Chief Wiggum: And Simpson, seeing how this is your first day, you're inexperienced and vulnerable, your beat is Junkyville and Bumtown.
(Street: ext. street - day)
Marge Simpson: Hello, Mr. Hutz.
Milhouse Van Houten: (QUICKLY) Is Bart home?
Lionel Hutz: (DEFENSIVE) I'll have you know the contents of that dumpster are private. you stick your nose in, you'll be violating attorney/dumpster confidentiality.

Marge Simpson: (SATISFIED) That's better.
(House: ext. house)
Marge Simpson: I got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address.
Seymour Skinner: Yes, indeed there is. There's an inflatable bath pillow that mother and I both enjoy. She claimed it was her day to use it. I maintain she was mistaken. We quarreled. Later, as I prepared to bathe, I noticed to my horror, that "someone" had slashed the pillow.
Marge Simpson: (UNIMPRESSED) Um-hmmm. Who called the police?
Agnes Skinner: We both did.
Marge Simpson: Look, why don't you two settle down. I'm sure you can get another pillow.
Seymour Skinner: Well, I could send it back to Taiwan for repair, but why should I have to? I've done nothing wrong. (TO CAMERA) And I don't give permission for my face to be on TV. I want it blurred.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY)
Lisa Simpson: So, Mom, what are you gonna do with your day off?
Marge Simpson: I just want to relax and forget that I'm part of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos (RELAXED SIGH).
Marge Simpson: Bart, it's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet.
Bart Simpson: But Mom--
Marge Simpson: It's for your own safety.
(Street: EXT. STREET - DAY)
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Take that, safety boy.

Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Law abiding. I'm done.
Marge Simpson: Moe, I've never seen you here before.

Ned Flanders: (HALF-HEARTED LAUGH) Oh.
Homer Simpson: But you thought they were.
Ned Flanders: Yeah.
Homer Simpson: That's why it was so funny. (LAUGHS; THEN) But they're not.
Ned Flanders: (HALF LAUGH) That's a good one.
(Springfield Police Station: Int. police station - day)
Marge Simpson: And that's the drunk tank, and this is mommy's desk.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, I know your intentions are good, but aren't the police a protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elites? Don't you think we ought to attack the roots of social problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons?
Marge Simpson: Look, Lisa. It's McGriff the Crime Dog.
Marge Simpson: (McGRIFF VOICE) Hello, Lisa. Help me bite crime. Ruff, ruff.
(Simpson Kitchen: INT. SIMPSON KITCHEN - NIGHT)

Carl Carlson: Hey, Homer, you sure it's okay to smoke Cuban cigars and gamble here now that your uh, wife's a cop?
Homer Simpson: Are you kidding? Being a cop-husband is one mighty sweet deal: this police radio entertains me with other peoples' miseries; we get a free funeral for Marge, God forbid; and I can run background checks on whomever I want (POINTEDLY TO MOE) Mohammar--
Moe Szyslak: (URGENT WHISPER) Homer, please, please, ix-nay on the ohammar-may.
Homer Simpson: Hey, hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've got you clocked at two miles per hour.
Lenny Leonard: C'mon, put that away. Those radar guns give you cancer.
Homer Simpson: All the more reason to hurry up. (LOOKING AT READOUT) Hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --
Marge Simpson: (STUNNED GASP) Illegal gambling in my house?!
Moe Szyslak: (NERVOUSLY COVERING) Yo-your house?! Your house? Gee, it's so glamorously decorated I thought I was in Vegas. (ACCUSINGLY TO OTHERS) Hey you guys lied to me! You said it was Vegas!
Players: We'll be goin'... / We'll just be goin'... / We don't want no trouble, officer...
Homer Simpson: Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies.
Marge Simpson: I didn't mean to.
Homer Simpson: Oh, you've become such a cop! (WISTFUL) And, not that long ago, you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs.
Marge Simpson: I'm still all those things. Only now I'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system.
Homer Simpson: You're cooking what for dinner?
(Street: EXT. STREET - DAY)
Marge Simpson: Everywhere I look, someone is breaking the law. Dog, no leash. Man littering. Horse not wearing diaper. Car parked across three handicapped spaces...

Homer Simpson: I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to get some beer for those kids over there.
Marge Simpson: I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that, but you have to move your car now.
Homer Simpson: I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
Marge Simpson: Oh, that's it. I'm gonna write you a ticket.
Homer Simpson: C'mon, we're family.
Marge Simpson: You're breaking the law.
Homer Simpson: I'll make you a deal. You rip up that ticket, and I'll give you back your hat. Wuh, wuh, wuh! Hee, hee-hee!
Marge Simpson: Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense.
Homer Simpson: (TAUNTING HIGH VOICE) What're you gonna do about it? What're you gonna do? (SILLY NOISES) Ooh, I'm Officer Marge, I'm gonna arrest you! Whoa! etc.
Homer Simpson: (SURPRISED NOISE, THEN SLYLY) Whuh! Marge, not here. (REALIZING) Hey, you're not really arresting me...?

Hans Moleman: But, he ate my last meal.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, if that's the worst thing that happens to you today, consider yourself lucky.
Hans Moleman: Are you really allowed to execute people in a local jail?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: From this point on, no talking.
(Bedroom: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer. But what I did was right. Someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there.
Homer Simpson: I have nothing more to say to you, Marge. I'm drawing a line down the center of the house à la "I Love Lucy" -- you stay on your side and I'll stay on my side.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(KITCHEN: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT)
Homer Simpson: Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the Police Academy, I thought it'd be fun and exciting, you know, like that movie, "Spaceballs." But instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie "Police Academy."
Barney Gumble: Hey, Homer, I'm worried about the beer supply. After this case and the other case, there's only one case left.
Barney Gumble: Yeah, yeah, Barney's right. / Yeah. / Let's get some more beer. / Hey what about some beer? / Yeah, Barney's right!
Homer Simpson: (GETTING UP) All right guys, pipe down. I've got some more in the garage.
Herman Hermann: (RISING) I'll, I'll-I'll get it, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Hmm... I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.
Moe Szyslak: "Garage?" Hey fellas - "the garage". Ooo la de da, Mr. Frenchman.
Homer Simpson: Well, what do you call it?
Moe Szyslak: A car-hole.
(GARAGE: INT. GARAGE)
Sinister Man: You're late, Herman.
Herman Hermann: Surely you don't mind waiting for merchandise of this quality, Mr. Jericho.
Sinister Man: Ah, looks like good stuff. But, of course, I'll have to sample it first.
Sinister Man: Well, these are fabulous.
Herman Hermann: Yeah, who would suspect that they're... counterfeit jeans.
Sinister Man: And what better place to make the buy than in a cop's garage where no one would suspect a thing.
Homer Simpson: Hey Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny - (GASPS) A counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here.
Herman Hermann: Not so fast.
Homer Simpson: Okay.
Herman Hermann: Maybe you should just stop entirely.
Homer Simpson: Herman, how could you? We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? Hard working designers, like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt, or Antoine Bugle Boy. These are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, "me too."
Herman Hermann: Advance on him, men.
Marge Simpson: I don't think that's a very good idea.
Henchman: Oh, no. It's Gloria Vanderbilt out for revenge!
Marge Simpson: No, it's Officer Simpson - of the police!
Homer Simpson: Herman, your beef is with me. Leave the girl out of this.
Herman Hermann: Okay.
Marge Simpson: (CONCERNED GASP) Homer!
Homer Simpson: It's too late for me, Marge! Sell the jeans and live like a queen.

Marge Simpson: Freeze!
Marge Simpson: Freeze! Every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Marge. You saved my life! I'm sorry I teased you. You're a really good cop. I'm proud of you.
Herman Hermann: So long, gotta catch the 501.
Homer Simpson: He's gettin' away! (POINTING FINGER) You blew it, Marge!
Marge Simpson: (COCKY) I don't think so.
Herman Hermann: Oh! Foiled by my own shoddy merchandise. Gee!
(Backyard: EXT. BACK YARD - LATER)
Grampa Simpson: That's my ambulance! I called for it four hours ago.
Homer Simpson: Marge, how did you know...
Marge Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) That the pants would rip?...
Homer Simpson: No, what I was wondering is...
Marge Simpson: Years of buying pants for two active children and a full-seated husband has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching, which these jeans have in spades.
Chief Wiggum: That's some nice work, Simpson. But um, we can't hold him, there's no evidence.
Homer Simpson: Yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans.
Chief Wiggum: (EYES DARTING) Ah, they've uh, mysteriously, uh, disappeared.
Chief Wiggum: Looking good, boys.
Marge Simpson: That's it! There's too much corruption on this force. I quit!

Bart Simpson: (ZOOMING OFF) No time.
Professor Jonathan Frink: Okay.
Bart Simpson: This is for the ages.
Tour Guide: Like Stonehenge, this site will forever be a mystery. Who was "Bart," and how did he manage to write his name in solid cement?
1st Tourist: (ASIDE) He must have been much smarter than his sister Lisa, about whom we know nothing.
2nd Tourist: Say, let's bring him back to life by using technology.
Bart Simpson: Ay caramba!
1st Tourist: What's normal to him amazes us.
2nd Tourist: He will be our new God.
Bart Simpson: Aah. Oh, good, somebody's shadow. I'll just turn and brag about my work.

Bart Simpson: It was an accident. (PULL OFF SOUND)
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: I can't believe you vandalized your own home town, Bart. What would Jebediah Springfield say?
Bart Simpson: (POKING AT HIS FOOD) I think he'd be cool with it.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?
Homer Simpson: What for? Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.
Marge Simpson: Well, I am just shocked by this whole family. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride?
Lisa Simpson: It's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire.
Marge Simpson: Now just a darned minute! This town is a part of who you are.
Marge Simpson: This is a Springfield Isotopes cap. When you wear it, you're wearing Springfield. When you eat a fish from our river, you're eating Springfield. When you make lemonade from our trees you're drinking Springfield.
Bart Simpson: Mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring Springfield.
Marge Simpson: Bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it. This town is a part of us all, a part of us all, a part of us all. Sorry to repeat myself but it'll help you remember.
(Springfield Street: EXT. SPRINGFIELD STREET - DAY)

Milhouse Van Houten: (GASP) We've squozen our whole supply! To the lemon tree!
(Springfield: EXT. - SPRINGFIELD)

Shelby: Springfield sucks!
Bart Simpson: Hey, stop talking bad about my town, man.
Shelby: Why don't you make me?

Backpack Kid: Aw. You copied us!
Milhouse Van Houten: Step over this line and say that. I'll kick your butt. (QUIETLY) At Nintendo.
Shelby: I just put a rock in your crummy town.
Bart Simpson: That's a crud rock. It belongs in crud town.
Shelby: Look at the weak little baby. You're stupid, you stupid weak baby. (TO HIS GANG) Come on, let's get outta here.
Bart Simpson: Hey! They're taking our lemons!
Milhouse Van Houten: We can't spare a single one!
Shelbyville Kids: Ow! Ow!
Shelby: You just got citric acid in my eye. You'll pay for that, Springfield.

Grampa Simpson: Grampa's the name. Did you know this tree dates back to frontier times?
Grampa Simpson: Shut up! It all began when Jebediah Springfield first came to these lands with his partner, Shelbyville Manhattan...
Springfield: People, our search is over! On this site we shall build a new town, where we can worship freely, govern justly, and grow vast fields of hemp for making rope and blankets.
Shelbyville: Yes! And marry our cousins.
Springfield: I was... Wha.. What are you talking about, Shelbyville? Why would we want to marry our cousins?
Shelbyville: Because they're so attractive. I-I, I thought that was the whole point of this journey.
Springfield: Absolutely not!
Shelbyville: I tell you, I won't live in a town that robs men of the right to marry their cousins.
Springfield: Well, then we'll form our own town! (TO PIONEERS) Who will come and live a life devoted to chastity, abstinence, and a flavorless mush I call "rootmarm"?
Grampa Simpson: The town of Springfield was born on that day. And to mark that sweet moment our people planted this lemon tree. Lemons being the sweetest fruit available at the time.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - NEXT DAY)
Bart Simpson: Those Shelbyville kids think they're so hot. But you know what? They're not.
Milhouse Van Houten: I really agree with you on this one, Bart.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Class, please. If you don't learn Roman Numerals, you'll never know the dates certain motion pictures were copyrighted.
Nelson Muntz: Everybody come quick! Something's happened! No time to explain!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (HALFHEARTEDLY) No, children, no. Your-your education is important. Roman Numerals. Etcetera. Whatever.
(Springfield Street: EXT. SPRINGFIELD STREET)
Milhouse Van Houten: Are you sure (BREATH) it wouldn't be faster to just tell us what happened?
Nelson Muntz: No. I said there's no time to explain, and I stick by that.
(LEMON TREE AREA: EXT. LEMON TREE AREA)
Bart Simpson: The lemon tree's gone!
Martin Prince: And the tracks appear to lead into Shelbyville.
Database: Oh. Look, a clue! A candy bar wrapper!
Milhouse Van Houten: (BITTER) Oh, they're always eating candy in Shelbyville. They love the sweet taste.
Bart Simpson: We gotta get that tree back!
Database: (SCARED) Euh. You mean, go into Shelbyville? Euh. We'll never make it out alive!
Bart Simpson: That lemon tree's a part of our town, and as kids, the backbone of our economy. We'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY)
Marge Simpson: Where you going, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Mom, you won't believe this, but something you said the other day really got through to me.
Marge Simpson: (PLEASED NOISE)
Bart Simpson: (MENACINGLY) And now I am going to teach some kids a lesson.
Marge Simpson: I choose to take that literally.
Bart Simpson: Death to Shelbyville!
Homer Simpson: Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, Son! Tute on!
(Van Houten Home: ext. milhouse's home)
Bart Simpson: (CALLING TO WINDOW) Hey, Milhouse -- get your invasion supplies and let's go!
(Van Houten Home: INT. MILHOUSE'S HOUSE)
Tough Kid: What the -- ? Where'd he go?
Milhouse Van Houten: Over here, my friends. (DISAPPEARING AND REAPPEARING) Or is it over here?
Milhouse Van Houten: Yeah.
(BORDERLAND: EXT. BORDERLAND - DAY)
Bart Simpson: Okay, here's how it goes. I'm the leader. Milhouse is my loyal sidekick. Nelson is the tough guy, Martin's the smart guy and Todd's the quiet religious guy who ends up goin' crazy. And now, the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger. To step out of childhood and become men.
(Shelbyville Street: EXT. SHELBYVILLE STREET - DAY)
Bart Simpson: If you get lost remember, you can always find east by staring directly at the sun.
Martin Prince: Here's a tip. Put a pinch of sage in your boots, and all day long a spicy scent is your reward.
Milhouse Van Houten: Oh my gosh-- look!
Milhouse Van Houten: The fire hydrants here are yellow.
Nelson Muntz: (NERVOUS) This place is startin' to freak me out.
Todd Flanders: Danger coming. Behind us.
Backpack Kid: What is it boy? Is there something behind that wall we should beat up?
Shelby: No time to check it out now. We've got lemonade to sell. (GLOATING LAUGH)
Backpack Kid: (LAUGH) Radical.
Bart Simpson: They're gettin' rich off us!
Milhouse Van Houten: And that kid with the backpack said "radical!" I say "radical." That's my thing that I say. I feel like I'm gonna explode here! (GRUNT)
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY)
Marge Simpson: It's almost lunch time. Do you know where your brother is tutoring?
Lisa Simpson: (SCOFFS) Tutoring? The only thing Bart's teaching is guerilla combat in Shelbyville.
Marge Simpson: Well, do you have a number where we can reach him?
Lisa Simpson: No, Mom! Bart and some kids ran off to wage war on Shelbyville.
Marge Simpson: (GASP) Homer, come quick! Bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence-gang!
(Shelbyville Park: EXT. SHELBYVILLE park - DAY)
Database: Euh. The trail has become indistinct. I suggest we split up, to cover more ground.
Bart Simpson: Good idea. Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team. Todd, you and Data are Team Strike Force. Nelson, that leaves you and Martin.
Martin Prince: Team Discovery Channel!
Nelson Muntz: (GROAN) Your wussy-ness better come in handy.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY)
Parents: Hey, where's my... / What's going on?/ I want some answers, damnit!
Ned Flanders: Okay, okay folks, look. I called the Police Captain in Shelbyville. He says he hasn't seen our kids, but if they show up in the morgue he's gonna fax us.
Kirk Van Houten: Man, I hate those Shelbyville jerks!
Luann Van Houten: Honey, I was born in Shelbyville.
Kirk Van Houten: And it tears me up inside.
Marge Simpson: This is my fault. I tried to teach Bart about town pride, but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness.
Shelby: We just got word there's Springfield kids in town!
Homer Simpson: Now, Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech. If anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. And let's not forget your little speech...
Marge Simpson: Isn't there anything we can do?
Homer Simpson: Yes, there is. (TO THE CROWD) Come on, everybody, let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves! I got an R.V. we can use... Flanders's!
Dads: Yeah!/ Let's do it!/ Yeah!
Ned Flanders: (MILD FUMFERING PROTEST) Well, okay, but, you know, just go a little bit easy on the...
Homer Simpson: Pile in, everybody! No time to wipe your feet!
(Shelbyville Street: EXT. - SHELBYVILLE STREET - DAY)
Martin Prince: Okay piglet, start squealing! Where'd you get the lemons for this lemonade?
Small Kid: Ah. This is Countrytime Lemonade Mix. There's never been anything close to a lemon in it, I swear!
Bigger Kid: Hey! Nobody hassles my little brother.
Martin Prince: Hey, and no one manhandles the bosom chum of Nelson Muntz. Spring forth burly protector and save me!
Nelson Muntz: Oh, geez. (TO THE SHELBYVILLE KID) I never hang out with him, normally.
Martin Prince: (SINGING) Hark to the tale of Nelson and the boy he loved so dear...
Martin Prince: (SINGING) They remained the best of friends for years and years and years!
(Shelbyville Hillside: EXT. SHELBYVILLE HILLSIDE - DAY)
Milhouse Van Houten: What are they saying?
Bart Simpson: I'm not sure.
Milhouse Van Houten: I thought you said you could read lips.
Bart Simpson: I assumed I could.
Bart Simpson: Aw. It's no use, Milhouse. If we're gonna find that lemon tree, I've got to go undercover. What I need is a new face.
Milhouse Van Houten: (VERY CONFIDENT) You leave that to the Baron and me.
(Shelbyville Street: EXT. Shelbyville STREET - Day)
Bart Simpson: Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians.
1st Kid: Wait a minute. If you're from Shelbyville, how come we've never seen you at school?
Bart Simpson: I don't go to school.
2nd Kid: Okay. What's two plus two?
Bart Simpson: Five.
1st Kid: Eh, story checks out...
Bart Simpson: Curse those handsome devils.
Shelby: We're going up to the bluffs to paint "Springfield Sucks" in huge letters. That way, whenever they look into Shelbyville, they will realize that they suck.
Backpack Kid: Uh, radical.
Milhouse Van Houten: Quit copying me--!
Shelby: (POINTEDLY TO BART) You know, I wish there was a Springfield kid here right now. I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs.
Bart Simpson: No, not in my mouth! (CATCHING HIMSELF) Aye--is what the kid would say. To the bluffs!
(FLANDERS R.V.: INT. FLANDERS R.V.)
Ned Flanders: Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors. I, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town.
Gas Station Attendant: Missing children?
Customer: Sounds like Springfield's got a discipline problem.
Second Customer: Maybe that's why we beat 'em at football nearly half the time. Huh? (TAUNTING LAUGH)
(Shelbyville Bluffs: EXT. SHELBYVILLE BLUFFS)
Shelby: Quit stallin', kid. Write "Springfield Sucks" in giant letters.
Bart Simpson: (RELUCTANT GROAN)
Shelby: His can control is excellent.
2nd Kid: Yes. And that wig makes him look a lot like one of the Beatles.
Bart Simpson: That's right. The stranger who walks amongst you is me, Bart Simpson!
Shelbyville Kids: Huh?
Bart Simpson: You know, Bart Simpson. From Springfield?
Shelby: He's from Springfield! Get him!
Bart Simpson: I'll use these spray cans as jet packs and fly to safety. So long, losers!
Bart Simpson: (WEAK LAUGH)
Shelby: You're dead.
Bart Simpson: Uh... hey, look! Someone's attractive cousin.
Shelbyvillers: (À LA SLACK-JAWED YOKEL) Huh? Really? Where? Lemme see.
Bart Simpson: (OBNOXIOUS LAUGH)
Shelby: So he thinks he can out skateboard me, huh? Launch me, boys!
Groundskeeper Wilma: Slow down, you sidewalk surfin' cube- gleamers!
Bart Simpson: Uh oh, wet cement!
Bart Simpson: I could sure use that flying motorcycle now.
Professor Jonathan Frink: You had your chance. (FRINK NOISE)
Bart Simpson: (SIGH) Safe at last!
(BIG CAT BUILDING: INT. BIG CAT building)
Bart Simpson: (READING) "CAUTION: Exit through door seven only. All other rooms contain man-eating tigers."
Bart Simpson: (BITTER) Roman Numerals. They never even tried to teach us that in school.
Bart Simpson: Milhouse! What's seven in Roman Numerals?
(Hill: Ext. hill)
Milhouse Van Houten: I'll tell you, Bart. But you really should end each transmission with the word "over". Over.
Backpack Kid: Correction -- the only thing that's over is that transmission.
Milhouse Van Houten: (GASPS) Is this the untimely end of Milhouse?
Backpack Kid: But... Milhouse is my name.
Milhouse Van Houten: I thought I was the only one.
Backpack Kid: (VERY MOVED) A pain I know all too well.
Milhouse Van Houten: (EVEN MORE MOVED) So this is what it feels like, when doves cry...
(BIG CAT BUILDING: Int. big cat building)
Bart Simpson: (INTO WALKIE TALKIE) Milhouse! Milhouse! Now what do I do?
Bart Simpson: Wait! I got it! I got it!
Bart Simpson: I don't got it.
Bart Simpson: Okay. Think, Bart. Where have you seen Roman Numerals before? I know, "Rocky Vee!" That was the fifth one. So "Rocky Five" plus "Rocky Two" equals "Rocky Seven: Adrian's Revenge!"
(Shelbyville Street: EXT. SHELBYVILLE STREET - A little later)
Bart Simpson: Oh, it's no use. I'm never gonna find that tree. This whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there. Wait a minute! There's a lemon behind that rock.
Bart Simpson: The tree!
Bart Simpson: (PAINED GROAN)
(GRASSY HILL: EXT. GRASSY HILL - LATER)
Martin Prince: (AWESTRUCK) A car impound lot, the impenetrable fortress of suburbia.
Milhouse Van Houten: We'll never get the tree back now!
Bart Simpson: Keep your voices down, boys. We didn't come this far to get found out.
Homer Simpson: Found 'em!
Homer Simpson: You kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this.
Bart Simpson: But they stole our lemon tree!
Homer Simpson: I don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!
(IMPOUND LOT: EXT. IMPOUND LOT)
Executive #3: (FAST) Package for parcel processing. Pronto.
Homer Simpson: That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers. Give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!
Tow Truck Man: Bust in here and take it? You must be stupider than you look.
Homer Simpson: (CRESCENDING) Stupider like a fox!
Homer Simpson: I'm okay. (MOAN)
Tow Truck Man: Hu-hu-hu-hu. Don't you get it, Springfield? It's over. You lose. Now if you'll excuse me, all this talk has made me hungry.
(FLANDERS R.V.: INT. FLANDERS R.V.)
Homer Simpson: This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield. If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.
Bart Simpson: There's got to be a way to get that tree back. (ON TO SOMETHING) Hey, look. A hospital! Pull in there.
Homer Simpson: Oh, great. Now I'm upside-down.
(Shelbyville Hospital: EXT. SHELBYVILLE HOSPITAL - continuous)
Tow Truck Man: Oh, dear. Some thoughtless human being has parked in a hospital zone. (GROAN)
Tow Truck Man: (SINGING) AND I THINK TO MYSELF, WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD...
(IMPOUND LOT: EXT. IMPOUND LOT - EVENING)
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLE) No one in history has ever done anything this clever.
Bart Simpson: I'll get the gate.
Homer Simpson: (COCKY) That's okay, son. I'll take care of him.
Homer Simpson: Faster, son -- he's got a taste for meat now!
(R.V.: int. r.v.)
(Street: ext. streeT)
Tow Truck Man: Get out here, son -- there's-a doin's transpiring!
Tow Truck Man: Let's shut the gate and seal them in!
(R.V.: int. r.v.)
Bart Simpson: Gun it, Flanders!
Ned Flanders: It won't start! Something's draining the battery?!
Homer Simpson: Sorry.
Ned Flanders: (PAINED NOISE)
Bart Simpson: We made it!
Homer Simpson: Woo-hoo!
Bart Simpson: Eat my shorts, Shelbyville!
Bart Simpson: Eat my shorrrrrrrts!
Ned Flanders: Yes. Eat all of our shirts.
Tow Truck Man: Ooh! Ya lousy Springfielder! (TO SHELBY) Shake harder, boy!
(Street: Ext. Street)
(LEMON TREE AREA: Ext. Lemon tree area)
Waylon Smithers: (FAST) Perk up, Prendergast. Profoundly pressing package of power plant profit projections for Pete Porter in Pasadena.
Grampa Simpson: And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Springfield. They had brought the sacred tree back to its native soil, and though Flanders was stuck with the impound fee, he could easily afford it.
Milhouse Van Houten: More lemonade, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Absolutely.
Milhouse Van Houten: Say when.
Shelbyville Grampa: And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Shelbyville. They had banished the awful lemon tree forever, because it was haunted. Now let's all celebrate with a cool glass of turnip juice.
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. elementary school - hallway - continuous)
Seymour Skinner: Ah, is there nothing so intoxicating as the school hallway at early morn?
Seymour Skinner: Hmm. School normally doesn't smell so... rank.
Seymour Skinner: Ahh. Washbasin fresh. (LOOKS AROUND) That funk must be coming from one of the classrooms.
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. school - Bart's classroom - continuous)
Seymour Skinner: (SIGH) Poor fellow. Crushed by his own water bottle...
Seymour Skinner: Willie, sometime over the holiday weekend, the beloved Grade Four gerbil, er, Superdude, lost his life. I need you to air out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial.
Groundskeeper Willie: (DISGUSTED GROAN)
Groundskeeper Willie: (TO BOX) Yer lucky yer getting a decent burial! Me own father got thrown in the bog!
Groundskeeper Willie: What in the name of St. Ephesiocritus?! (EE-FEEZ-EE-OCK-RIT-US)
Groundskeeper Willie: (YELLS)
Bart Simpson: Yuck. What reeks?
Nelson Muntz: Smells like one of Van Houten's!
Milhouse Van Houten: It does not!
Ralph Wiggum: Miss Hoover? The floor is shaking.
Miss Hoover: (SKEPTICAL) Ralph. Remember the time you thought the --
Ralph Wiggum: (DOPPLER YELL) Mommmmy!!!
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: Int. power plant - board room - continuous)
C. Montgomery Burns: Now, before we adjourn, gentlemen, I have one last matter of utmost importance. I need to send this parcel with the profit projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena - (OMINOUS) And it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight!
Executive #1: (FAST) Pete Porter. Pass it on.
Executive #2: (FAST) Pasadena. Promptly.
Prendergast: (FAST) Priority?
Waylon Smithers: (FAST) Precisely.
Homer Simpson: (EAGER) Here's your package, Mr. Burns!
C. Montgomery Burns: (LIVID SPUTTERING) My name is the return address, you senseless dunderpate! Smithers, who is this nincompoop?
Homer Simpson: (BARELY FAZED) --son!
C. Montgomery Burns: (RE: WEIGHT) Sounded large when I ordered it. (SIGH) I can't make hide nor hair of these metric booby-traps.
(Springfield Elementary School Roof: Ext. the school roof - later that day)
Seymour Skinner: My Lord. Such destruction.
Seymour Skinner: Superintendent Chalmers! (NERVOUS) How are you going?
Gary Chalmers: Why is it when I heard the word "school" and the word "exploded," I immediately thought of the word "Skinner"?
Seymour Skinner: I-I-I-I-I...
Engineer: Congratulations, gentlemen. Your custodian struck oil. You're standing on top of the richest elementary school in the state.
Engineer: We also found this.
Seymour Skinner: (SOTTO) Thank you, Superdude.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: Int. Power plant - Penthouse - the next morning)
C. Montgomery Burns: (GRUNT) Bah! A non-profit organization with oil? I won't allow it! (MIFFED) An oil well doesn't belong in the hands of Betsy Bleedingheart and Maynard G. Muskie-vote!
Waylon Smithers: (OUT OF BREATH) Sir, have you had enough exercise for this morning?
C. Montgomery Burns: No. Let's do another twenty miles.
Waylon Smithers: Ugh!
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello, Lenny, Carl, Guillermo...
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello... (CAN'T REMEMBER) Eh... do..er... uh... Oooh...umm...
Lenny Leonard: Don't take it so hard, Homer. He's always screwin' up people's names.
Guillermo: Yeah. At the picnic, he thought my son Reynaldo was my son Rolando. Can you believe that?
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. school - principal's office - later)
Seymour Skinner: Superintendent, we made the front page today!
Gary Chalmers: Uh, what's that say under your hand there?
Seymour Skinner: Hm, it's an unrelated article.
Gary Chalmers: It's an unrelated article. Within the banner headline?
Seymour Skinner: Yes. Now, to re-direct our conversation slightly, I had a few ideas on how to spend this oil money.
Gary Chalmers: Well, we could give each student a full college scholarship.
Gary Chalmers: (UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER)
Seymour Skinner: Oh mercy. Seriously though, before we draw up the budget, I believe the students and faculty have a few suggestions...
Groundskeeper Willie: I want a crystal bucket for my slop-water. Oh, and a brand new filthy blanket.
Lunchlady Doris: The cafeteria staff is complaining about the mice in the kitchen. (BEAT) I want to hire a new staff.
Lisa Simpson: I'd like to start a jazz program for the music department. We've got a really great instructor lined up...
Gary Chalmers: (EXCITED) Tito Puente!
Lisa Simpson: He's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo circuit and settle into a nice teaching job.
Tito Puente: Man, it will be my pleasure. Lisa has told me all your students are as bright and dedicated to jazz as she is.
Lisa Simpson: (NERVOUS CHUCKLE, EYES DARTING) Let's go now, Mr. Puente.
Ralph Wiggum: Chocolate microscopes...?
Otto Mann: You know those guitars that are like double guitars... you know?
Seymour Skinner: More rubber stamps.
Voice: (INTERCOM SOUND, THEN) Principal Skinner, this is your secretary. There is one last student here to see you.
Seymour Skinner: That's odd. I don't have a secretary, or an intercom. But send him in.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ahoy there, Dean! I understand you're taking suggestions from students, eh? Well, me and my Fourth Form chums think it would be quite "corking" if you'd sign over your oil well to the local energy concern!
Seymour Skinner: (CLEARS THROAT) Mr. Burns...
C. Montgomery Burns: (CAUGHT) Bheh!
Seymour Skinner: It was naive of you to think I would mistake this town's most prominent 104 year-old man for one of my elementary school students.
Moe Szyslak: Hey! If you guys are getting loaded off them fumes, I'm gonna have to charge ya.
C. Montgomery Burns: I want that oil well! I've got a monopoly to maintain! I own the Electric Company and the Waterworks, plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue.
Seymour Skinner: That hotel's a dump, and your monopoly is pathetic. The school's oil well is not for sale. (BUILDING) Particularly to a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself!
C. Montgomery Burns: I see. Then I'll just have to... AT-TTACK YOU!
C. Montgomery Burns: (FIGHTING NOISES) I must have that oil! Oogh! (PANTS) Smithers! Smithers, help me subdue this beast!
Waylon Smithers: (ENTERING) Sorry, sir, this is all I could find! Take that! And that!
Seymour Skinner: (CALMLY) Please don't waste those.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson House - dining room - night)
Marge Simpson: I'm happy for the school. It sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities.
Bart Simpson: Big deal. They didn't approve my idea. They said it was "unfeasible."
Lisa Simpson: It is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart. And even if the Three Stooges were alive, I doubt they'd want to hang around with you.
Bart Simpson: (CONSIDERS THIS) Well, um, yeah. I guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?
Homer Simpson: (WHINY MOAN) I hate my job. I mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?
Marge Simpson: I have an idea.
Homer Simpson: (EAGER) What? What's your idea?
Marge Simpson: When my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it. After that, she never forgot him.
Homer Simpson: That's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now Marge?
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: Int. power plant - Burns' office - the next day)
C. Montgomery Burns: That's it. Frimble about with your widgets and doobobs. It'll all be a monument to futility when my plan comes to fruition.
Waylon Smithers: Sir... uh, (CLEARS THROAT) What I'm about to say violates every sycophantic urge in my body, but: I wish you would reconsider. This isn't a rival company you're battling with. It's a school. People won't stand for it.
C. Montgomery Burns: Pish-posh. It will be like taking candy from a baby.
C. Montgomery Burns: Say, that sounds like a larf. Let's try it right now.
Krusty the Clown: (UNCERTAIN) Hey hey.
Waylon Smithers: Ah, ub, there's some candy right here, Sir. Why don't we eat this instead of stealing?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, very well.
Waylon Smithers: (EATING NOISES)
Waylon Smithers: Oh, look, there's a photo in here.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHEWING) Hmm, yes. I believe that's little Maggie Simpson -- the baby who found my precious teddy-bear Bobo. Oh and there's that, ah Simpson mutt, my former guard dog.
C. Montgomery Burns: (STILL CHEWING) Ooh uh, uh, that's B-Bart Simpson. He was my heir for a brief period, you know.
Waylon Smithers: Yes, Sir, I remember.
C. Montgomery Burns: Anything left?
Waylon Smithers: Only the sour quince log, Sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (REPULSED SOUND) Dispose of it. (THOUGHTFUL) And uh, send a thank-you note to Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson.
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. school - a few days later)
Seymour Skinner: Today, Springfield Elementary embarks on a new era: an era of unbridled spending where petro-dollars will fuel our wildest educational fantasies. These young minds will enjoy every academic advantage... (BEAT, CHUCKLING) ...until they enter Springfield High School, which has no oil well.
High School Student: (SQUEAKY TEENAGE VOICE) We got an air hockey table!
Seymour Skinner: Fine. Now, to switch on our oil pump for the very first time, here's our top student, Lisa Simpson.
Nelson Muntz: Nerd!
Engineer: There's no pressure! Someone else has tapped this well!
Tito Puente: Ay carumba!
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah. Soon that mighty apparatus will burst forth with its precious fluid. Almost sexual, isn't it, Smithers?
Waylon Smithers: (GRUMPY) Eh.

Santa's Little Helper: (CHEERFUL PANTING, BARK)
Bart Simpson: I'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy. I swear it.
Veterinarian: Oops, almost forgot. Wouldn't want you gnawing on those casts, eh boy?
Nelson Muntz: Haw haw!
Nelson's Parrot: (SQUAWK) Haw haw! (WHISTLE)
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. school - principal's office - day)
Seymour Skinner: I'm afraid we've got no legal recourse against Mr. Burns and his slant- drilling operation. The oil belongs to whoever pumped it first.
Groundskeeper Willie: What about all the expensive stuff we wanted? Can we still have it?
Seymour Skinner: No.
All Teachers: (ROARS OF OUTRAGE AND DISBELIEF)
Seymour Skinner: In fact, to pay for the construction, and operation, and demolition of our new derrick, the school will have to eliminate all non-essential programs: music...
Tito Puente: What?! / Que?!
Seymour Skinner: And maintenance.
Groundskeeper Willie: I'll kill that Mr. Burns!! (BEAT, LESS ENRAGED) And wound that Mr. Smithers. Outta my way!
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - living room - night)
Lisa Simpson: Oh, no. that's awful, Mr. Puente. (BEAT) What? Oh. He owns the nuclear power plant. (BEAT) Yeah, I'd like to settle his hash, too.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, how can you work for a man like Mr. Burns?
Homer Simpson: Well, he's not all bad. He did send me this nice thank-you card.
Lisa Simpson: "Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie." Dad, this doesn't have your name on it.
Homer Simpson: (CREEPILY CALM) Kids, would you step outside for a second?
Homer Simpson: (DEEP BREATH, THEN) F-F-F-F-F-F-

Larry: (DRUNK SOUND, COLLAPSES, BODY FALL)
Male Inspector: (SHOCKED) Man alive! There are men alive in here!
Female Inspector: I'm detecting over twenty different toxins in the air.
Barney Gumble: (BELCH)
Male Inspector: All right, everybody out! As long as Burns is pumping oil, this bar is closed.
Moe Szyslak: Damn Burns... (STEELY-EYED RAGE) Lemme just get one thing.
Barney Gumble: Me too.
Barney Gumble: Ahhhh, now there's the inflated sense of self-esteem.

Waylon Smithers: (SLIGHTLY BITTER) Well, Sir, you've certainly vanquished all your enemies: the elementary school, the local tavern, the old age home. You must be very proud.
C. Montgomery Burns: (DRAMATIC) No, not while my greatest nemesis still provides our customers with free light, heat, and energy. I call this enemy... the sun!
C. Montgomery Burns: Since the beginning of time man has yearned to destroy the sun. I will do the next best thing -- block it out.
Waylon Smithers: Good God!
C. Montgomery Burns: Imagine it, Smithers. Electrical lights and heaters running all day long.
Waylon Smithers: But Sir, every plant and tree will die; uh, owls will deafen us with incessant hooting... the town sundial will be useless.
Waylon Smithers: (CLEARS THROAT) -II don't want any part of this project. It's unconscionably... fiendish.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ENRAGED GASP) I will not suffer your insubordination! There has been a shocking decline in the quality and quantity of your toadying, Waylon, and you will fall into line. Now.
Waylon Smithers: (THE MOST DIFFICULT THING HE'S EVER SAID) No... No, Monty, I won't. Not until you step back from the brink of insanity.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'll do no such thing! You're fired!
C. Montgomery Burns: (DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER) Take that, bowl-a-rama! Take that, convenience mart! Take that, nuclear power pla-- (REALIZES) Oh, fiddlesticks.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - morning)
Marge Simpson: I must say Mr. Burns is being awfully inconsiderate. Selfish, even.
Patty Bouvier: Mr. Burns has been shot!
Bart Simpson: Burns needs some serious boosta-fazoo. Right, Dad? (NO RESPONSE) Dad? Homer?
Grampa Simpson: (SCREAM)
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, Grampa. It's just that, for a second, it looked like Dad had melted.
Grampa Simpson: Well, get used to it, cause I'm livin' here now. I ain't goin' back to the retirement home until they fish my bed outta that sinkhole.
Marge Simpson: Strained carrots for Maggie... Strained carrots for Grampa.
Grampa Simpson: (JEALOUSLY EYEING MAGGIE) I want a bib, too.

Homer Simpson: (DELIGHTED INSANE GIGGLE)
C. Montgomery Burns: Who the devil are you?!
Homer Simpson: Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Shut up! Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!
C. Montgomery Burns: (BEING SHAKEN) What? What are you talking about? Clearly make sense, man. I can't understand a word you're saying. You're just babbling incoherently like some sort of...
Homer Simpson: Oh, you're a dead man! Oh, you're dead! You're dead Burns!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - that evening)
Grampa Simpson: (RE: DOG) Hey, the lamps runnin' away.
Bart Simpson: (EMBARRASSED) That's my dog, man.
Grampa Simpson: So long, lamp. (TO BART) Now stop loafing, and help your Grampa unpack.
Bart Simpson: Wow!
Grampa Simpson: That's my old Smith & Wesson. If you're gonna play with it, be careful, 'cause it's loaded.
Marge Simpson: (SCREAM) Bart! Put that down! Guns are very dangerous, and I won't have them in this house.
Grampa Simpson: How can ya have a house without a gun? What if a bear came through the door?
Marge Simpson: (SOTTO) I'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to it. (EXITS)
Grampa Simpson: (FRUSTRATED, TO BART) Echt! You shoulda fired into the air! She woulda run off!
(Springfield Town Hall: int. town hall - continuous)
Mayor Joe Quimby: People! Take it easy! We're all upset about Mr. Burns' plan to uh block out our sun. It is time for decisive action! I have here a polite but firm letter to Mr. Burns' underlings who, with some cajoling, will pass it along to him, or at least give him the gist of it.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Also, it has been brought to my attention that a number of you are stroking guns. (BEAT) Therefore, I will step aside and open up the floor.
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns was the closest thing I ever had to a friend. (BITTER) But he fired me, and now I spend my days drinking cheap scotch and watching Comedy Central.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (APPALLED) Oh! Dear God!
Waylon Smithers: Aw. It's not that bad. I mean, I never miss "Pardon My Zinger."
Groundskeeper Willie: Burns cost me my groundskeepin' job at the school! And I'm too superstitious to take the one at the cemetery.
Grampa Simpson: A-causa him, I lost my room, my things, and my buddy's collection of old sunbathing magazines!
Old Jewish Man: (SHOCKED) You bastid!
Moe Szyslak: I lost my bar!

Milhouse Van Houten: (MOUTH FULL) Whug?
Bart Simpson: No, my dog!
C. Montgomery Burns: (EVIL SNICKER)
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, those wheels are squeaking a bit. Perhaps I could sell him a little oil.
Santa's Little Helper: (SNARLS THREATENINGLY AT MR. BURNS)
Bart Simpson: You twisted old monster!!
C. Montgomery Burns: Nuh-uh-uh.
C. Montgomery Burns: (WHEEZING) Won't... dignify that... with response.
C. Montgomery Burns: I've decided to protect myself... Ever since I was attacked in my office by an unidentified assailant.
Homer Simpson: (QUIET ANNOYED GRUNT)
Captain Horatio McCallister: Arr! Burns, yer scurvy schemes will earn ye a one-way passage to the boneyard!
Ned Flanders: Uh, I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel.
Sideshow Mel: I'll see to it that Mr. Burns suffers the infernal machinations of Hell's grim tyrant!
Otto Mann: Yeah!
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, you all talk big, but who here has the guts to stop me?
C. Montgomery Burns: (KNOWING) Mmm hmm. Very well. One last question: (TAUNTING) Have you ever seen the sun set at 3:00 PM?
Captain Horatio McCallister: Aye! Once when I was sailing 'round the Arctic Cir...
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up, you! Take one last look at the sun, Springfield.
Krusty the Clown: Hey, hey! (CHUCKLES) I've been in Reno for six weeks. Did I miss anything? (OFF THEIR MURDEROUS LOOKS:) What the.. (KRUSTY GROAN)
(TOWN HALL STEPS: ext. town hall steps - a few minutes later)
Lunchlady Doris: Eternal darkness. Well, that's just great.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Listen, someone's got to get that Mr. Burns. Uh, where's a gun-toting low-life when you need one?
Snake Jailbird: Sorry, I was in the can.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ahhh. Perpetual twilight bathed in the glow of Burns brand electricity!
C. Montgomery Burns: (SPEAKING) Hello lamp post/ Whatcha knowin'? / I've come to watch your power flowing.
(Springfield Town Hall: int. town hall)
Carl Carlson: That's odd. Mr. Smithers left his jacket behind.
Otto Mann: Whoa. That's odd. Principal Skinner left his mother behind.
Marge Simpson: That's odd. Where's Homer? And Bart? And Lisa? And Grampa?
C. Montgomery Burns: After all these years, things are finally starting to go my way. I feel like celebrating. I...
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about? (GASP) I see. Well, I think you'd better drop it. (THREATENING) I said drop it! (VIOLENT STRUGGLING SOUNDS) Get your -- get your hands off-- (MORE VIOLENT STRUGGLING SOUNDS)
(FRONT OF TOWN HALL: int. front of town hall)
Marge Simpson: Where is everybody?
Marge Simpson: (GASP)
Jimbo Jones: Hey, man, are you okay?
Chief Wiggum: (NOTICES SOMETHING) Just a minute! This isn't Mr. Burns at all! It's a mask!
Chief Wiggum: Oh, wait. It is Burns. (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) His wrinkly skin looks... looks like a mask.
Marge Simpson: I don't think we'll ever know who did this. Everyone in town's a suspect.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (CHUCKLES) Well, I couldn't possibly solve this mystery. (TO CAMERA) Can you?
Chief Wiggum: Yeah, I'll give it a shot. I mean, you know, it's my job, right?
(Smithers's Apartment: INT. SMITHERS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY)
Waylon Smithers: (COTTON-MOUTH) Ugh. My mouth tastes like an ashtray. (DISGUSTED NOISES)
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, wait your turn. There's plenty of hot water for all.
Waylon Smithers: (STUNNED) Sir, you weren't shot? (DEEP SIGH OF RELIEF) It was all a dream.
C. Montgomery Burns: That's right. The year is 1965, and you and I are undercover detectives on the hot-rod circuit. (BEAT) Now let's burn rubber, baby!
Announcer: "Speedway Squad!" In color.
Waylon Smithers: Wait, that was all a dream. (BRIGHTENING) Hey, then maybe I haven't become a hideous, drunken wreck! (LOOKS AROUND)
Waylon Smithers: Oh. (BELCH)
Kent Brockman: Dozens of people are gunned down each day in Springfield, but until now, none of them was important. I'm Kent Brockman. At 3 p.m. Friday, local autocrat C. Montgomery Burns was shot following a tense confrontation at Town Hall.
Kent Brockman: Burns was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He was then transferred to a better hospital, where doctors upgraded his condition to "alive."
Kent Brockman: Now, let's talk to Police Chief Wiggum.
Chief Wiggum: Oh, hiya, Kent. Ah, right now we are questioning two witnesses who were in the vicinity at the time.
(Springfield Police Station: INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER)
Lou: Didja see this guy? Was he anywhere near the parking lot when Burns got shot?
Maggie Simpson: (TWO SUCKS)
Eddie: Aw, it's no use. They ain't talkin'.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM)
Lisa Simpson: Everyone in Springfield had a reason to shoot Mr. Burns. Even us.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, he broke your dog's legs. Grampa, he destroyed your home. And Dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name.
Homer Simpson: (SUDDENLY CRAZED) Berserk is right!! (SUDDENLY CALM) May I have some iced tea, please?
Bart Simpson: Aren't we forgetting someone, Sister Suspect?
Lisa Simpson: (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Yeah, I was just getting to me. Because of Mr. Burns, they canceled my jazz program, and my friend Tito Puente got fired. But I could never shoot someone.
Bart Simpson: Could so!
Lisa Simpson: Could not!
Bart Simpson: Could so!
Lisa Simpson: Could not!
Bart Simpson: Could so!
Lisa Simpson: Could not!
Bart Simpson: Could so!
Lisa Simpson: Could not!
Homer Simpson: Kids! Kids! Kids! As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers.
Marge Simpson: The police already have a suspect. It's Mr. Smithers.
Grampa Simpson: (TOO EAGER) Sure, Smithers! / He's a good suspect! / Oh, I bet he's the one! / Definitely Smithers! (ETC.)
Grampa Simpson: (OVEREAGER, FAST) Yeah! Smingers did it! Case closed. Now, where's my hat? I'm going to the outhouse.
Lisa Simpson: We don't have an outhouse.
Homer Simpson: (ALARMED GASP) My tool shed! Oh Dad!
(Downtown Street: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - A FEW DAYS LATER)
Waylon Smithers: Could I have shot Mr. Burns in a drunken rage? No. No, not me. I know in my heart I...
Smithers's Brain: (GASPS) My gun! (SNIFFS IT) And it's been recently fired! Wait, I remember leaving the town meeting...
Waylon Smithers: I must've run into Mr. Burns outside, and...
Waylon Smithers: (ANGRY DRUNKEN MURMURING, THEN:) (STRUGGLING SOUNDS)
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns! What have I done?!
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - SHADOWY DAY)
Moe Szyslak: Hey, Homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down Burns' sun blockin' machine. You wanna come with?
Homer Simpson: Sure! I've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
(Mt. Springfield: EXT. MT. SPRINGFIELD - SUN BLOCKER - A LITTLE LATER)
Groundskeeper Willie: (TO TRACTOR) Pull, Duchess, pull!
Krusty the Clown: Um... Uh, what town did we just crush?
Seymour Skinner: Shelbyville.
Townspeople: (BEAT, THEN:) Yay!!
(Downtown Street: ext. downtown street - later)
Waylon Smithers: Oh, this guilt is driving me mad. I've got to tell someone.
Waylon Smithers: Father, I'm not a Catholic, but... well, I tried to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade... Anyway, I've got a... rather large sin to confess. (DEEP BREATH, SNIFFLES) I'm the one who... (BREAKS DOWN) who shot Mr. Burns.
Chief Wiggum: That's all I needed to hear. (LOOKS AROUND) Boy, this thing works great.
(Springfield Police Station: INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - A LITTLE LATER)
Waylon Smithers: The man became consumed by greed. He'd steal from anyone.
Waylon Smithers: This isn't a rival company you're battling with. It's a school. People won't stand for it.
C. Montgomery Burns: Pish-posh. It will be like taking candy from a baby.
C. Montgomery Burns: Say, that sounds like a larf.
Waylon Smithers: And when he tried to steal our sunlight, he crossed that line between everyday villainy and cartoonish super-villainy.
SUPER-VILLAIN: Bah! He was a rank amateur compared to Dr. Colossus! (EVIL LAUGH)
SUPER-VILLAIN: (RUBBING HIS HEAD) Ow. When is my lawyer coming?
Reporters: Mr. Smithers! / Smithers! / Over here, Waylon! / (ETC.)
Dave Shutton: Dave Shutton, Springfield Daily Shopper. Who are you? Where are you going?
Kent Brockman: Oh, do your research, Shutton! (TO SMITHERS) Ah, Kent Brockman, Channel Six News. How does it feel to be accused of the attempted murder of your boss and mentor?
Waylon Smithers: Kent, I, I feel about as low as Madonna when she found out she missed Tailhook.
Reporters: (APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES)
Kent Brockman: I'm going to say "ouch!" for Madonna.
(Krusty's Office: INT. KRUSTY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS)
Krusty the Clown: (OUTRAGED) Hey! That's my Madonna gag! That guy stole my gag!
Sideshow Mel: And you stole it from last Friday's episode of "Pardon My Zinger."
Krusty the Clown: Stole, made-up, what's the difference? (NERVOUS LAUGH)
Sideshow Mel: Mr. Smithers must have seen that program, too. He never misses it. Hm.
Sideshow Mel: At the town meeting, he mentioned that he watched Comedy Central. I made sure to note that, as it seemed quite unusual. (BEAT THEN: EYES WIDEN) Ye Gods. To the police station, Krusty!
(Springfield Police Station: INT. POLICE STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER)
Sideshow Mel: I am Melvin Van Horne, and this is my associate Herschel Krustofsky.
Sideshow Mel: Officer, you have arrested an innocent man!
Chief Wiggum: Really? Aw, jeez.
Chief Wiggum: All right, Colossus, you're free to go. But stay away from Death Mountain.
SUPER-VILLAIN: (WHINY) All my stuff is there.
Sideshow Mel: (CLEARS THROAT) I was referring to Waylon Smithers. Mr. Burns was shot Friday at 3:00 p.m. -- the very time that Smithers was at home watching "Pardon My Zinger." So you see, he couldn't have done it.
Waylon Smithers: (GASP) Yes! You're right! I remember now! I - I watched that entire show! In fact...
Waylon Smithers: I left the town meeting early so I could get home in time.
Waylon Smithers: (SLURRING) Agh. I've gotta run, or I'll miss the opening rank-out.
Waylon Smithers: (ANGRY DRUNKEN MURMURING)
Jasper Beardly: Slow down! The sidewalk's fer reg'lar walkin', not fer fancy-walkin'.
Waylon Smithers: (STRUGGLING SOUNDS) (DRUNK) Out of my way. I'm in a hurry.
Jasper Beardly: You simmer down, I'll letcha go.
Waylon Smithers: (GLUM) So... Instead of wounding an evil old man, I may have killed an innocent old man. That's much worse.
Krusty the Clown: About fifty-thousand volts worse, if you know what I mean. (MAKES SWITCH-PULLING GESTURE) Eeeeh! Bzzzt! Sizzle...
Chief Wiggum: Wait a minute. If a second old geezer got shot, how come nobody reported it?
(Springfield Retirement Castle: INT. RETIREMENT CASTLE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER)
Chief Wiggum: Uh, hi. Um, can we take a look at your leg?
Jasper Beardly: Yeah, that's real spruce. You like it?
Waylon Smithers: Phew. Thank God. Sir, I, I only hope you can forgive me for shooting your wooden leg.
Jasper Beardly: You shot who in the what now?
Chief Wiggum: Okay, Smithers, you're free to go. (TO JASPER) And you, one question: do you know who shot Mr. Burns, cause we are really up the creek on this one. (CHEESY EMBARRASSED LAUGH).
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - TV ROOM - NIGHT)
Kent Brockman: And with the prime suspect cleared and found completely innocent, we must now ask ourselves: "Who could possibly be as bloodthirsty as Waylon Smithers?"
Marge Simpson: I guess it's never the most likely suspect.
Lisa Simpson: Look at Burns' suit. Yeesh.
Lisa Simpson: Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is. The rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason.
Homer Simpson: Hey, I had a damn good reason. He could never remember my name...
C. Montgomery Burns: Who the devil are you?
Homer Simpson: (ANGUISHED YELL) Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! (ETC.)
C. Montgomery Burns: (BEING SHAKEN BABBLING)
Lisa Simpson: Well, I don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder.
Grampa Simpson: Eh, you never know what you're capable of. I never thought I could shoot down a German plane -- but last year, I proved myself wrong.
Lisa Simpson: Nancy Drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends. And I've got an inquisitive temperament! Maybe I could help solve this!
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR) I think you're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder. Why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer?
Bart Simpson: Who wants chocolate ice cream?
Homer Simpson: Me! Me! Me, me!
(Springfield Police Station: INT. POLICE STATION - THE NEXT DAY)
Chief Wiggum: Okay boys, we've got a clue - the bullet they took out of Burns. Now, let's discuss the, um...
Chief Wiggum: "Motive." (MOH-TIVE)
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Burns is the richest man in town. Maybe it was about money.
Chief Wiggum: That's some good thinking, Lou.
Lou: Thanks, Chief.
Lisa Simpson: Hey! I said that. My name is Lisa Simpson, and I made a chart of all the suspects in the Burns case. Look.
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Burns hurt all these people financially: nightclub owner Moe Szyslak. His bar was closed because of Burns' negligence; liquor connoisseur Barney Gumble. When Moe's closed, Barney lost his only means of support -- sucking coins out of the Love Tester machine.
Eddie: That's a real good way to get sick.
Lisa Simpson: Dedicated educator Principal Seymour Skinner. His school lost millions when Burns pirated its oil well; and grounds-tender Groundskeeper Willie. He lost his job and his dream of owning a fine crystal slop bucket.
Eddie: I had an idea, Chief. Why don't we check out that suit Burns was wearing when he got shot?
Chief Wiggum: Hey, what about that jazz teacher that got laid off? You know, um, Mister Samba? Señor Mambo? What was it?
Lisa Simpson: Tito Puente?
Chief Wiggum: Yeah.
Lisa Simpson: (LAUGHS) Well, he did vow revenge. (OFF THEIR INTRIGUED LOOKS) But I can't see him doing something illegal -- he's in show business! He's a celebrit--
Chief Wiggum: Let's roll, boys.
(Street: EXT. STREET - A LITTLE LATER)
(NIGHTCLUB: INT. NIGHTCLUB - A FEW MINUTES LATER)
Tito Puente: Revenge? Of course. But why wound his body with bullets when I can set his soul afire with a slanderous mambo? Listen, if you will, to my revenge. Uno, dos, tres...
Crooner: (SINGING) WOUNDS WON'T LAST LONG / BUT AN INSULTING SONG / BURNS WILL ALWAYS CARRY WITH HIM. / SO I'LL SETTLE MY SCORE / ON THE SALSA FLOOR / WITH THIS VENGEFUL LATIN RHYTHM! / BU-URNS! CON EL CORAZON DE PERRO! / SENOR BU-URNS! EL DIABLO CON DINERO! (MORE)
Crooner: (BIG FINISH) THIS MAY NOT SURPRISE YOU / BUT ALL OF US DESPISE YOU / PLEASE DIE / AND FRY / IN HELL / YOU ROTTEN, RICH, OLD WRETCH! ADIOS, VIEJO!
Chief Wiggum: Yeah! Okay, okay, I believe you're innocent. Gee, I hope all the suspects are this much fun.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER)
Seymour Skinner: (SLOW) Hum-m-m. Now-now let, let... me... let me think.
Chief Wiggum: (FRUSTRATED SOUND)
Seymour Skinner: (BEAT) Now, I did - I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns. When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to apply my camouflage makeup...
Seymour Skinner: Blast! I took mother's makeup kit by mistake.
Gary Chalmers: Oh, uh, excuse me, ma'am.
Seymour Skinner: Superintendent Chalmers!
Gary Chalmers: (REALIZING; SICKENED) Oh my God!
Chief Wiggum: So Superintendent Chalmers can vouch for your whereabouts?
Seymour Skinner: Oh yes. But, anything else he tells you is a filthy lie.
(Springfield Police Station: INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER)
Groundskeeper Willie: I'm tellin' ya, I could nay have shot Burns!
Eddie: (BRANDISHING HIS GUN) This is your last warning about that.
Chief Wiggum: Did you have that same backwards-talking dream with the flamin' cards?
Eddie: (SHOOTS HIM A LEERY LOOK) I'll drive.
Groundskeeper Willie: It's impossible for me to fire a pistol. If you'll check me medical records, you'll see I have a cripplin' arthritis in me index fingers! Look at 'em!
Groundskeeper Willie: I got it from Space Invaders in 1977.
Chief Wiggum: Oh yeah, that was a pretty addictive video game.
Groundskeeper Willie: Video game?
Eddie: Did you hold a grudge against Montgomery Burns?
Moe Szyslak: No.
Moe Szyslak: All right, maybe I did. But I didn't shoot him.
Eddie: Checks out. Okay, Sir, you're free to go.
Moe Szyslak: Good, cause I got a hot date tonight. (BEEP) A date. (BEEP) Dinner with friends. (BEEP) Dinner alone. (BEEP) Watching TV alone. (BEEP) All right. I'm gonna sit at home and ogle the ladies in the Victoria's Secret catalog. (BEEP) (ASHAMED) Sears catalog.
Moe Szyslak: Now wouldja unhook this, already please?! I don't deserve this kind of shabby treatment! (BEEP)
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY)
Marge Simpson: (UPSET) Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there. Have you seen it?
Grampa Simpson: You accuse me of everything around here. (SARCASTIC) Who put slippers in the dishwasher? Who threw a cane at the TV? Who fell into the china hutch?
Marge Simpson: I was just asking if you'd seen it. There's no need to be a prickly pear.
Grampa Simpson: Oh, you're the bee's knees, baby. I missed you bad.
Marge Simpson: Were you talking to me, Grampa?
Grampa Simpson: (COVERING) Um... yes?
Marge Simpson: (DISGUSTED SHUDDER)
(Springfield Police Station: INT. POLICE STATION - MIDNIGHT)
Chief Wiggum: We're still not close. Boy, this is gonna be an all-night brain buster. Better drink some coffee.
Chief Wiggum: Oh, we're out of coffee. Oh well, I'll just drink this warm cream.
Lisa Simpson: (BACKWARDS VOICE) Chief Wig-gum... Don't eat... the clues.
Lisa Simpson: This suit burns better. Look.
Chief Wiggum: Huh?
Lisa Simpson: Better... look... burns... suit.
Chief Wiggum: I'm not following you.
Lisa Simpson: Burns' suit! Burns' suit! (NORMAL VOICE)
Chief Wiggum: Huh?
(Hospital: INT. HOSPITAL - BURNS' ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT)
Chief Wiggum: Eureka!
Technician: (WISEGUY VOICE) Ooh, nice eyelash. Yours?
Chief Wiggum: No. We need to find out who it belonged to. We want a D.N.A. test.
Technician: Ooh, ooh, ee, ooh, ooh... That takes eight to ten weeks.
Technician: Did I say weeks? 'Cause I meant seconds.
Chief Wiggum: Whaddya got the whole town's D.N.A. on file?
Technician: Yuh-huh. If you've ever handled a penny, the government's got yer D.N.A. Whyddya think they keep 'em in circulation?
Technician: Scan's finished. Now it's gonna narrow it down to the family bloodline.
C. Montgomery Burns: Homer Simpson!
Eddie: Bingo. The gunman has a name-o.
Lou: Chief! Chief! Chief!
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY THAT MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: Hey, Chief Wiggum, what are you doing? What's going on?
Chief Wiggum: I'm sorry, kid. We got Simpson D.N.A. on Burn's clothing and your father was identified by the old man himself.
Lisa Simpson: (SHOCKED GASPS)
Bart Simpson: D.N.A., positive I.D. -- Those won't hold up in any court -- Run, Dad!
Lou: Hey-ho. Look what I found under Mr. Simpson's car seat.
Homer Simpson: I swear, I've never seen that gun before.
Eddie: Then why are your fingerprints all over it, sir?
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEK)
Chief Wiggum: This bullet matches the one we took out of Burns. (SLAPS CUFFS ON HOMER) Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for attempted murder.
Homer Simpson: (DISTRAUGHT ANNOYED GRUNT)
Chief Wiggum: Yeah, that's what they all say. ...They all say, "D'oh."
(PADDY WAGON: INT. PADDY WAGON - A LITTLE LATER)
Chief Wiggum: Yeah we need two cups of coffee, and two orders of Bite-Size Breakfast Pancakes. With extra dipping sauce.
Teenage Employee: (SQUEAKY VOICE) Please pull up to the service window, please.
Chief Wiggum: The wagon's too tall. Aw, I don't wanna have to get out. Ah, I'll just drive up on the curb.
Chief Wiggum: Ergh... Blugh... Almost got it...
Lou: Drop the food, Chief!!
Chief Wiggum: Noooooo!
Jasper Beardly: Dang fools. Drive-thru's not fer a-parkin'.
Teenage Employee: Dianne, I'm going to take my break now.
(Hospital: INT. HOSPITAL - BURNS' ROOM - THAT MORNING)
Dr. Nick Riviera: Hi, everybody!
C. Montgomery Burns: (WAVING; À LA "HI, DR. NICK") Ho, Mersimp Son!
Dr. Nick Riviera: (SLIGHTLY ALARMED) Okay, that was a little strange. Um tell me, how are you feeling today?
C. Montgomery Burns: (TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE) Ho-mer... Simpson, Homer. (SAID AS PROFANITY; ANNOYED GRUNT) Simpson!
Dr. Nick Riviera: Hmm... That seems to be all you can say. When you were in that coma, did you feel your brain getting damaged?
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER)
Marge Simpson: (VERY CONCERNED) The police have such a strong case against Homer. Mr. Burns said he did it, they have Homer's D.N.A...
Lisa Simpson: They have Simpson D.N.A. It could've come from any of us. Except you, since you're a Bouvier.
Marge Simpson: No. No, no. When I took your father's name, I took everything that came with it, including D.N.A.
Lisa Simpson: (WEIRDED OUT) Okay, Mom. Anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems. Like those fingerprints. They could've gotten on the gun some other way.
Lisa Simpson: Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones?
Homer Simpson: (DERISIVE SNORT) Yeah, right. You chose fruit, you live with fruit.
Homer Simpson: (WHINY ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer Simpson: No. No. No. Ewww. Why is this on the floor?
Lisa Simpson: And we don't even know whose gun that was. Maybe somebody planted it there to frame Dad.
Marge Simpson: No. We can't start thinking that way about our own family members. Suspicion could tear us apart.
Grampa Simpson: That's right. We all gotta stick together if we're gonna have any hope of bringing that awful Homer to justice.
(Springfield Police Station: INT. POLICE STATION - A FEW HOURS LATER)
Chief Wiggum: Here is a photo of the fugitive from our files.
Chief Wiggum: And now Waylon Smithers -- ah who's been a real good sport about that wrongful arrest thing (RELIEVED WHISTLE; LAUGH) -- has a statement that he would like to make. Waylon?
Waylon Smithers: Thank you. As Montgomery Burns' closest friend, I am certain that there is nothing he would want more than swift, brutal revenge against Homer Simpson. Therefore, I am offering a $50,000 reward for his capture. Dead or alive.
Crowd: (EXCITED FRENZY)
Chief Wiggum: Me first! Me first!
(Hospital: INT. HOSPITAL - BURNS'S ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER)
C. Montgomery Burns: Homer Simpson?
Homer Simpson: (QUIET RAGE) So you finally learned my name, eh?
C. Montgomery Burns: Homer Simpson.
Homer Simpson: (CONFUSED BEAT) I've got no time for your demented parlor games! (OMINOUS) You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you.
(Springfield Town Hall: EXT. springfield TOWN HALL - THAT MINUTE)
Lisa Simpson: The scene of the crime! There must be something here that can clear Dad.
Pigeon: (COOING) Clue, clue.
Lisa Simpson: (REALIZING) That's it! Oh, Mr. Pigeon, I'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease.
Lisa Simpson: (GASP) So, the D.N.A. was right. It must've been... Oh, Dad!
Police Dispatcher: Attention all units. Homer Simpson has been sighted. Proceed at once to Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital.
Lisa Simpson: (GASP)
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Be careful when we capture him! We cannot claim the reward unless we have fifty-one per cent of the carcass.
(Hospital: EXT. HOSPITAL - FRONT STEPS - ONE MINUTE LATER)
Lisa Simpson: Stop! Don't shoot my Dad! He's innocent. He wouldn't hurt a fly!
C. Montgomery Burns: Ho-mer Simp... son. Ho... mersimp... son.
Homer Simpson: Stop telling them it was me. I'll kill you for saying it was me.
C. Montgomery Burns: Mersimp... Son... what is the... mer... meaning of this? Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?
Homer Simpson: Say it Burns. Say I never shot you... Before.
C. Montgomery Burns: Shot? (LAUGHS) By you? I'm afraid not my primitive friend. Your kind has neither the cranial capacity nor the opposable digits to operate a firearm. The one who shot me was...
C. Montgomery Burns: (PANICKED SCREAMS) Ma.. Maggie Simpson!
C. Montgomery Burns: With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world...
C. Montgomery Burns: So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.
C. Montgomery Burns: I feel like celebrating.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about?
C. Montgomery Burns: (GASPS) I see.
Director: Look, we just want to make movies. Not kill things.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes... (LICKING SOUNDS) that's the one. Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance.
C. Montgomery Burns: I think you'd better drop it!
C. Montgomery Burns: But the old exhume was misleading. Taking the candy proved exceedingly difficult.
C. Montgomery Burns: I said drop it! (GRUNTS)
C. Montgomery Burns: Stricken I lurched forth in search of aide.
C. Montgomery Burns: But finding only slacked jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial.
Lisa Simpson: Then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to W and S.
Lisa Simpson: Or from your point of view, M and S... Maggie Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: What? No! With my last ounce of strength I sucked out my gold fillings and swallowed them. Those paramedics have sticky fingers.
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you've recovered and we can all get back to normal. If Maggie could talk I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you.
C. Montgomery Burns: I' afraid that's insufficient. Officer, arrest the baby.
Chief Wiggum: Yeah right pops. No jury in the world is gonna convict a baby. (THINKING) Mmm... except maybe Texas.
Marge Simpson: Besides, she didn't mean it. It was an accident.
(The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop: Ext. The Android's dungeon - establishing - day)
Bart Simpson: Aw, all these new superheroes suck. None of them can hold a candle to Radioactive Man.
Milhouse Van Houten: The only decent new one is Radiation Dude.
Bart Simpson: (SNORTS) Nah, he's just a cheap imitation of Radioactive Man.
Milhouse Van Houten: Explain.
Bart Simpson: The similarities are subtle, but many. For example, Radioactive Man has his famous catchphrase "Up and Atom" (EXPLAINING) - with atom spelled a-t-o-m in a delicious pun...
Milhouse Van Houten: (NODDING) Go on.
Bart Simpson: ... while Radiation Dude has a similar, but lamer catchphrase: "Up and Let's Go."
Comic Book Guy: So, you kids fancy yourselves experts, eh?
Bart Simpson: (COCKILY) Well, between us we've read all 814 issues of Radioactive Man.
Moe Szyslak: Yeah.
Milhouse Van Houten: Yeah, and we both have the special limited edition issue where he and Fallout Boy get killed on every page.
Comic Book Guy: Well, I suppose you know then that Hollywood is planning a feature film about "Radioactive Man."
Comic Book Guy: I have got to do something about that air conditioner suction.
Bart Simpson: (EAGERLY) Who's gonna play Radioactive Man?
Comic Book Guy: I will tell you in exactly seven minutes.

Old Board Member: I don't see why Rainier Wolfcastle should be the star. I think we should bring back Dirk Richter. Kids will wanna see the original Radioactive Man.
Producer: (PATIENTLY) I keep telling you. He's 73 years old and he's DEAD.
Old Board Member: Granted, but...
Director: Besides, we want to stay as far away from the campy 70s version as possible.
Fallout Boy: Billowing backpacks, Radioactive Man! It's the worst villain of them all: The Scoutmaster!
Radioactive Man: (GRIMLY) I see him, Fallout Boy.
Scoutmaster: (À LA PAUL LYNDE) Go get 'em, scouts!
Scoutmaster: Don't be afraid to use your nails, boys! (LAUGHS)
Producer: So, where could we shoot this picture? We need a city that has a nuclear reactor and a gorge, and can guarantee us the full cooperation of city officials.
Assistant: I'll check "Variety."
Producer: Wow! Look at that ad!
Producer: All right. This place must be hot. They don't need a big ad or even correct spelling.
Old Board Member: I agree with that logic.
Producer: (INTO INTERCOM) Get me two plane tickets to the state that Springfield is in.
(Springfield Town Hall: Int. city hall - Mayor Quimby's office)

Moe Szyslak: Yeah.
Homer Simpson: Which one were you? The ugly one?
Homer Simpson: Were you the ugly one?
Moe Szyslak: No. I was the tough kid. Smelly. My shtick was looking into an exhaust pipe and gettin' a faceful of soot. Heh, nobody could do that better than me. Of course, it was kinda hard to think of reasons for me to look in that exhaust pipe every time, but you know, we had good writers. William Faulkner could write an exhaust pipe gag that would really make you think.
Barney Gumble: If you were such a big shot, why aren't you still making movies?
Barney Gumble: Moe?... Moe?
Moe Szyslak: Oh no! My favorite aggie!
Moe Szyslak: You stole my bit! You... That's my bit ya... Ya... ooh, ooh, you stole my bit!

Moe Szyslak: Yeah. Luckily, Alfalfa was an orphan owned by the studio.

Bart Simpson: (MISERABLE) I just missed out on the greatest opportunity of my entire life. George Burns was right (TOSSES DOLL) -- show business is a hideous bitch goddess.
Lisa Simpson: Cheer up, Bart. Milhouse is still gonna need a true friend. Someone to tell him he's great, someone to rub lotion on him, someone to hurl whiskey bottles at when he's feeling low.
Bart Simpson: You're right, Lis. I can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to God.
Homer Simpson: Guess what, kids. They're gonna pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here.

Otto Mann: Should we give them some of their money back?
Milhouse Van Houten: I like the way the blush brings out my cheekbones, but it's not worth it. And making movies is so horribly repetitive. I've said "jiminy jillikers" so many times the words have lost all meaning.
Director: We've got to do the "jiminy jillikers" scene again, Milhouse.
Milhouse Van Houten: (LOW) But we already did it. It took seven hours, but we did it. It's done.

(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: Int. power plant)
Director: (INTO MEGAPHONE) Okay, listen up, everybody. This is the hardest, most expensive scene in the movie and we only get one shot at it so we have to do it right. Fallout Boy will untie Radioactive Man and pull him to safety, moments before he's hit with a forty- foot wall of sulfuric acid that will horribly burn everything in its path. Now, that's real acid. So I want to see goggles, people.
Radioactive Man: Real acid?

Bart Simpson: (NODDING SAGELY) Television.
Milhouse Van Houten: No! Curing heart disease and wiping out world hunger.
Bart Simpson: But Milhouse! They haven't cured anything. Heart disease and world hunger are still rampant. Those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers. Every last one of them. Want results? You have to go to the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones, and, to a lesser extent, the Van Dammes.
Milhouse Van Houten: Mickey Rooney!

Mickey Rooney: Uh, they tapped your treehouse phone.
Mickey Rooney: Milhouse, listen. You can't quit this movie. I've seen your work. It's good, very, very good. Van Johnson good.
Milhouse Van Houten: I know I'm good. Movie stardom is just so hollow.
Mickey Rooney: Hollow? The only thing in show business that's hollow is the music industry. C'mon, Milhouse, ya have to do this. If not for yourself, then for the movie-going public, and for the foreign markets that are more important than ever nowadays... and finally, for me, the Mickster.
Milhouse Van Houten: No.

Grampa Simpson: (INCOHERENT BABBLE)
Officer Goodman: (INTO TAPE RECORDER) A disheveled and malnourished man found sleeping in his own filth. Seems confused and dehydrated.
Officer Noble: Where is the baby?
Grampa Simpson: That's her, ain't it?
Grampa Simpson: Kids love that water.
Officer Noble: Oh my Lord!
Officer Goodman: Stupid babies need the most attention.

Lisa Simpson: (NORMAL VOICE) I don't know. They should be here.
Officer Goodman: Yes. They should be here.
Officer Goodman: Those parents better have a good excuse.

Marge Simpson: (VERY ALARMED) What are you doing with my children?!
Officer Noble: We're taking them where you can't get them.
Marge Simpson: (GRASPING AT KIDS) What?! No! You can't! I won't let you!
Officer Noble: Mrs. Simpson. Restrain yourself or you'll be arrested.
Officer Goodman: (REASSURING) Now just relax, kids. All we're doing is taking you to a (SURPRISINGLY SINISTER) foster home!

Bart Simpson: Uh, please don't hug me. It sickens me.
Maude Flanders: I don't judge Homer and Marge, that's for a vengeful God to do.
Ned Flanders: Mmm-hmm. All we want to do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together.
Lisa Simpson: You don't understand. Mom and Dad take good care of us.
Lisa Simpson: (WHISTLES WHILE SHE TALKS) That was a baby tooth... it was loose...
Officer Noble: Don't you worry, little girl. We'll get you some nice county dentures.

Homer Simpson: (SINGING KAZOO-LIKE TO BEETHOVEN'S FIFTH) Saxa-ma-phone. Saxa-ma-phone. (WISTFUL SIGH)
Marge Simpson: I can't believe I put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. That is so like me.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs the hell outta me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a houseplant.
Homer Simpson: Lousy houseplant! (GRUNTS)
(Flanders Home: Int. FLANDERS HOUSE - PLAYROOM - NEXT DAY)
Todd Flanders: Go with it!
Bart Simpson: Here you go, Todd. The city edition.
Rod Flanders: Bart, I don't know if this should be an extra.
Todd Flanders: Is your source on this reliable?
Bart Simpson: (EXASPERATED NOISE, TURNS TO LISA) I hate this place.
Lisa Simpson: (LOOKING AROUND) Yeah. It seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy Pat Boone-ish quality to it.
Ned Flanders: Hey, kids! Nachos, Flanders-style! That's cucumbers with cottage cheese.
Ned Flanders: Oh, Bart. I know you're still getting adjusted here. (INDULGENTLY) Tell you what. We'll do whatever you want to do.
Bart Simpson: Watch Itchy and Scratchy!
Ned Flanders: (FRIENDLY CHUCKLE) Well, I guess a little television won't hurt. (CONFIDENTIAL ASIDE) I used to let the boys watch "My Three Sons," but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime.
Scratchy: (WEAKLY) Why? Why? (AS HE IS DYING) My only son. (DIES)
Rod Flanders: Daddy, what's the red stuff coming out of Kitty's ears?
Ned Flanders: (COVERING) Uh, er, that's just raspberry jam.

Judge Snyder: No, I don't care for children.
Homer Simpson: Now wait a minute! Okay, I'm not gonna win Father of the Year. In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. (THINKS) Wait, can I start again? Fathering children is the best part of my day... I'd do anything for Bart and Lisa!
Judge Snyder: (LOOKING AT FILE) And Margaret?
Homer Simpson: Who? Lady, you got the wrong file.
Marge Simpson: (WHISPER) It's Maggie!
Homer Simpson: Oh, Maggie. I got nothing against Maggie.
Judge Snyder: I can see you sincerely want your children back. But you have a lot to learn about being parents. Before I can return your children, you'll have to complete a course called Family Skills. It teaches parents to listen to their...
Homer Simpson: Communication. Gotcha.
Judge Snyder: But it's important to...
Homer Simpson: Listen. Yes, I know.
Judge Snyder: But there's more to it than...

Maggie Simpson: (GIGGLES)
Bart Simpson: I never heard Maggie laugh like that before.
Lisa Simpson: Well, when was the last time Dad gave her that kind of attention?
Bart Simpson: When she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her.
Lisa Simpson: I thought I could ride this thing out, but everything's just too weird here.
Bart Simpson: I know. They put honey on their pancakes instead of maple syrup.
Lisa Simpson: And they read Newsweek instead of nothing.
Ned Flanders: (NOTICING BART AND LISA) C'mon, you Gloomy Gusses. Who's up for a big bowl of non-fat ice milk?
Todd Flanders: I want wintergreen!

Officer Goodman: All right. Easy there, Flub. We're all gonna get a chance. Mrs. Skinner, why are you here?
Agnes Skinner: The county is threatening to take my Seymour away. We had another fight over the inflatable bath pillow. (GETTING IRKED) I kept screeching and screeching at him but--
Officer Goodman: (TO CLASS) All right... Very good. Now, who knows how the Skinners could have resolved this problem...without resorting to violence...or childish name-calling?
Officer Goodman: Anybody? Okay, that's okay, because making a happy home isn't like flipping on a light switch.
Cletus Spuckler: (CONFUSED) Light switch?
Officer Goodman: There are a lot of little tricks to it, things you should have learned a long time ago. (SLIGHTLY CONDESCENDING) Such as: If you leave milk out, it can go sour. Put it in the refrigerator, or failing that, a cool, wet sack...
Officer Goodman: And put your garbage in a garbage can, people. I can't stress that enough. Don't just throw it out the window.
Marge Simpson: (TO SELF) This is so humiliating.
Homer Simpson: (WRITING FURIOUSLY, TO SELF) Garbage in garbage can. Makes sense.

Lisa Simpson: (SIGH)
Maude Flanders: THEY SAY YOUR FOLKS CAN'T PAY THE RENT/ SO WE'RE WATCHING YOU BY ACT OF GOVERNMENT.
Ned Flanders: WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE / BUT YOU GOT US, AND BABY, WE GOT YOU.
Ned Flanders: BABE. WE GOT YOU, BABE.
Lisa Simpson: You know, Maggie hasn't been a Simpson as long as us. I think she's beginning to forget Mom and Dad.
Bart Simpson: (FONDLY) Remember how Mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days?
Lisa Simpson: Or the way Dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips?
Lisa Simpson: (CHUCKLE THAT ENDS IN NOSTALGIC SIGH)
Lisa Simpson: They're ten feet away and we can't even talk to them. I wish I could tell them how much I miss them.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - upstairs hallway - continuous)
Marge Simpson: It's so quiet here without the kids.

Homer Simpson: I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now.
Marge Simpson: You mean Maggie?
Homer Simpson: That's it.
Marge Simpson: We've never been separated from the kids for so long. I don't know how much more I can take.

Ned Flanders: Righty-o!
Ned Flanders: Well...
Rod Flanders: I know!
Ned Flanders: No, Son, we've got to let Bart and Lisa get one. (TO BART AND LISA) C'mon, this one's easy.
Lisa Simpson: (BEAT) We give up.
Ned Flanders: Well, guess! Book of Revelations... Fire-breathing lion's head... tail made out of snakes... Who else is it gonna be?!
Bart Simpson: (UNSURE) Jesus?
Ned Flanders: (ANGUISHED MOAN, THEN WITH GROWING PANIC) Jes... ? Jes... ? Don't you kids know anything? The serpent of Rehaboam? (NO RESPONSE) The well of Zohassadar? (NO RESPONSE) The bridal feast of Beth Chadruharazzeb?
Maude Flanders: (APPALLED) Why, that's the kind of thing you should start learning at baptism.
Lisa Simpson: (SOFTLY, TENTATIVE) Uh, actually, the... (CLEARS THROAT) We were never baptized.
Ned Flanders: (FAINTING SOUND)

Marge Simpson: Oh, my.
Officer Goodman: Okay, the re-test says you're clean. Sorry about the mistake.

Ned Flanders: (ASTONISHED) Wait, Homer. What did you just say?
Homer Simpson: I said shut your ugly face, Flanders.
Ned Flanders: Oh, fair enough.

Bart Simpson: You shank. How could you tell on me?
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, I didn't want hungry birds pecking my soul forever.
Bart Simpson: Soul? Come on, Milhouse. There's no such thing as a soul. It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogeyman or Michael Jackson.
Milhouse Van Houten: But every religion says there's a soul, Bart. Why would they lie? What would they have to gain?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (SING-SONG) I don't hear scrubbing.
Bart Simpson: Well, if your soul's real, where is it?
Milhouse Van Houten: (RUBBING CHEST) It's kinda in here. (THEN BUILDING CONFIDENCE) And when you sneeze, that's your soul trying to escape. Saying "God bless you" crams it back in. And when you die, it squirms out and flies away.
Bart Simpson: Uh huh. What if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean?
Milhouse Van Houten: (SMUG) Oh, it can swim. It's even got wheels, in case you die in the desert and it has to drive to the cemetery.
Bart Simpson: (DISDAINFUL) How can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid? Listen. You don't have a soul, I don't have a soul, there's no such thing as a soul.

Bart Simpson: (PROUDLY) I sold my soul to Milhouse.
Lisa Simpson: What? How could you do that? Your soul is the most valuable part of you!
Bart Simpson: You believe in that junk?
Lisa Simpson: Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart, it's the symbol of everything fine inside us.
Bart Simpson: (TSK SOUNDS) Poor gullible Lisa. I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever. For five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years.
Bart Simpson: Well, if you think he got such a good deal, I'll sell you my conscience for four-fifty.

Barney Gumble: Well, look at the bright side, Moe. You still got us.
Moe Szyslak: (CHEERING UP) Yeah. Yeah, you know, that actually makes me feel a little better.
Homer Simpson: Why? That was the problem in the first place. You were going broke because we were your only customers. Wasn't that the problem in the first place? That you were going broke... Moe?
Homer Simpson: Moe? Hey, Moe? Oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha?
Homer Simpson: What was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... Moe? Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... Moe?

Bart Simpson: Who?
Comic Book Guy: I'm not at liberty to divulge the party, but they were most interested in having possession of a little boy's soul.

Bart Simpson: Are you there, God? It's me, Bart Simpson. I know I never paid too much attention in church, but I could really use some of that good stuff now. I'm afraid. I'm afraid some weirdo's got my soul and I don't know what they're doing to it. I just want it back. Please. (STARTS TO CRY) I hope you can hear this...
Bart Simpson: (DELIGHTED GASP)
Bart Simpson: Lisa! You bought this?
Lisa Simpson: With the change in my piggy bank.
Bart Simpson: There's no change in your piggy bank.
Lisa Simpson: Not in any of the ones you know about.
Bart Simpson: Oh Lis, thank you.

Grampa Simpson: (GROAN) Just leave me in the car with the window open a crack.
Homer Simpson: (CHEERFUL) That's the plan.
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR) I think it's nice we're doing something Maggie will enjoy for once. Besides, I'm sure Storytown Village is also fun for everyone... (GESTURING TO LISA) from 8, to... (GESTURING TO GRAMPA) God only knows.

Ned Flanders: And this is Lord Thistlewick Flanders...
Thistlewick Flanders: (BRITISH) Charmed.
Thistlewick Flanders: (RELUCTANTLY, WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM) Eh, a-googily-doogily.
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLE)
Homer Simpson: I can't believe you didn't invite me after I painted those cool stripes all over your car. (SNAPS FINGERS) I know! I'll throw my own barbecue - the greatest barbecue this town has ever seen! And I'll only invite who I want. That'll show ya.
Ned Flanders: Can I come?
Homer Simpson: Sure. (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer Simpson: This barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but I'm sure you're up to it, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting.
Homer Simpson: You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever.
Marge Simpson: Why thank you, Homie. (LOVINGLY) You might say the extra ingredient is salt.
Lamb: (FRIGHTENED BAAA-ING) Please, Lisa. I thought you lo-o-o-ved me. Lo-o-o-ved me!
Marge Simpson: What's wrong Lisa? Didn't you get enough lamb chops?
Lisa Simpson: (TEARY-EYED) I can't eat this. I can't eat a poor little lamb!
Homer Simpson: (FATHERLY) Lisa, get a hold of yourself. This is LAMB... not A lamb.
Lisa Simpson: What's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me?
Bart Simpson: This one spent two hours in the broiler.
Marge Simpson: Bart, sensible bites! All right Lisa. If you don't want lamb chops, there's lots of other things I can make: chicken breast, rump roast, hot dogs...
Lisa Simpson: No, I can't! I can't eat any of them!
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, honey -- are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon?
Lisa Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Ham?
Lisa Simpson: NO!
Homer Simpson: Pork chops?
Lisa Simpson: (FRUSTRATED) Dad... those all come from the same animal.
Homer Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Yeah, right, Lisa. A wonderful, MAGICAL animal. (CHUCKLES)

Class: Yay!
Miss Hoover: First, pin them down so they don't fly up and hit you in the eye.
Ralph Wiggum: (MOUTH FULL) Ah, Ms. Hoover?
MS. HOOVER: Yes, Ralph? What is it?
Ralph Wiggum: My worm went in my mouth and then I ate it. Can I have a new one?
Miss Hoover: No Ralph. There aren't any more. Just try to sleep while the other children are learning.
Ralph Wiggum: Oh boy, sleep! That's where I'm a Viking.
Worm: (LAMB VOICE) Lisa, what did I ever do to yo-o-o-ou?
Lisa Simpson: (TO HERSELF) Why does it talk like a lamb?
Lisa Simpson: Ah... Miss Hoover? I don't think I can dissect an animal. I think it's wrong.

(Simpson Home: int. Simpson house - living room - night)
Lisa Simpson: I never realized before, but some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny.
Bart Simpson: Say what? Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa. They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. Stuff like that.
Homer Simpson: Look, kids! I just got my party invitations back from the printer's.
Lisa Simpson: (READING) "Come to Homer's BBBQ. The Extra B is for BYOBB."
Bart Simpson: What's that extra b for?
Homer Simpson: That's a typo.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, can't you have some other kind of party? One where you don't serve meat?
Homer Simpson: But all normal people love meat. If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, "Yo, Goober! Where's the meat?" I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa. You don't win friends with salad.
Bart Simpson: YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...
Bart Simpson: YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...

Everybody: Huh? / What? / Gazpacho? / Etc.
Lisa Simpson: (CHEERFULLY SELLING) It's tomato soup served ice cold!
Troy McClure: Whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, Jimmy! You just asked a mouthful. (THEN) It all starts here in the high-density feed lot. Then when the cattle are just right...it's time for them to "graduate" from "Bovine University."
Troy McClure: C'mon, Jimmy. Let's take a peek at the killing floor.
JIMMY: (GASPS)
Troy McClure: Don't let the name throw you, Jimmy. It's not really a floor. It's more of a steel grating that allows material to sluice through so it can be collected and exported.
(Slaughterhouse Exit: Ext. slaughterhouse exit - later)
Troy McClure: Gettin' hungry, Jimmy?
JIMMY: (A BIT DISTURBED) Ahh, Mr. McClure? I have a crazy friend who says it's wrong to eat meat. Is he crazy?
Troy McClure: No, just ignorant. You see, your crazy friend never heard of the "food chain."
Troy McClure: Just ask this scientician.
Scientist: Uhhh --
Troy McClure: (INTERRUPTING) He'll tell you that in nature, one creature invariably eats another to survive.
Troy McClure: (OMINOUSLY) Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about.
JIMMY: Wow, Mr. McClure, I was a Grade-A moron to ever question eating meat.
Troy McClure: (GOOD-NATURED LAUGH) Yes you were, Jimmy. Yes you were.
JIMMY: (SOUND TRACK FADING) You're hurting me.
Lisa Simpson: They can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe!
Seymour Skinner: Now as a special treat courtesy of our friends at the Meat Council, please help yourselves to this tripe.
Lisa Simpson: Stop it! Stop it! Don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda?

Chief Wiggum: (LAUGHS DERISIVELY) Look at his nose!

Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Thanks Flanders. I have to agree that everything certainly... huh?

Bart Simpson: Give it up, dad. Piggy ain't comin' back.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, you ruined my barbecue. I demand you apologize this second!
Lisa Simpson: Oh, then you must think I'm a monster.
Lisa Simpson: I'm never ever apologizing because I was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room.
Homer Simpson: (FURIOUS) That's it! Go to your room!
Homer Simpson: (PRETEND POLITE) Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?
Marge Simpson: Please pass your father the syrup, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, tell Dad I'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product.
Bart Simpson: You dunkin' your sausages in that syrup, homeboy?
Homer Simpson: Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning.
Marge Simpson: Tell him yourself. You're ignoring Lisa, not Bart.
Homer Simpson: Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you're not not talking to me. And secondly, I heard what you said.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case.
Bart Simpson: Uh, Dad, Lisa's the one you're not talking to.
Homer Simpson: Bart, go to your room!
Lisa Simpson: Why don't you just eat him, Dad.
Homer Simpson: I don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all.

Lisa Simpson: (SURPRISED) Tofu?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: No, I don't eat any food that comes from an animal.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh, yes. No meat whatsoever, and only thrice the fat of a normal hot dog. I made the switch and nobody noticed.
Lisa Simpson: But why, Apu?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Because I'm a vegetarian. Haven't you ever seen my T-shirt?
Lisa Simpson: (SNIFFLY GIGGLE) That's cute.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Yeah. Let me show you something, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: Wow, a secret staircase? But what do you do if somebody wants a non-alcoholic beer?

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: I know it is not easy to be a vegetarian, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: That's why I ran away from home.
Voice: What? She's leaving home?
Lisa Simpson: Wow, Paul McCartney! I read about you in history class. But where's your wife, Linda?
Linda McCartney: Right here, Lisa. Whenever we're in Springfield, we like to hang out in Apu's garden in the shade.
Paul McCartney: We met him in India years ago during the Maharishi days.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Back then I was known as the fifth Beatle.
Paul McCartney: (CONDESCENDING) Sure you were, Apu.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: You know what, Lisa, Paul and Linda are vegetarians too. In fact, Linda has her own line of vegetarian entrees.
Lisa Simpson: Apu, I'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is...
Linda McCartney: We weren't satisfied with the other vegetarian meals on the market. You'd be surprised how often you find a big hunk of pork in 'em.
Lisa Simpson: Ewwww.
Paul McCartney: Linda and I both feel strongly about animal rights. In fact, if you play "Maybe I'm Amazed" backwards, you'll hear a recipe for a really ripping lentil soup.
Lisa Simpson: When will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains, and cheese?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (GASPS) Cheese?!
Lisa Simpson: You don't eat cheese, Apu?
(Lard Lad Donuts: INT. LARD LAD DONUTS - a minute later)
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Yes, indeed I do think that. But, I learned long ago, Lisa, to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them. You know you can influence people without badgering them always. It's like Paul's song, "Live and Let Live."
Paul McCartney: Actually, it was "Live and Let Die."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (SHRUG) Well, whatever, whatever. It had a good rhythm.
Lisa Simpson: I guess I have been pretty hard on a lot of people. Especially my dad. Thanks, you guys.
Paul McCartney: Lisa, before you go, would you like to hear a song?
Lisa Simpson: Wow, that'd be great!
Paul McCartney: Okay. Take it Apu.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (SINGING BADLY) I'm Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Man... I hope I will enjoy my show...

Lisa Simpson: Hi, Dad. Looking for me?
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) I dunno. Were you looking for me?
Lisa Simpson: (I DON'T KNOW NOISE)
Homer Simpson: (COMING CLEAN) Oh, Lisa, I was looking for you. I wanted to apologize. (SINCERELY) I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I know it's always my fault.
Lisa Simpson: Actually Dad, this time I was wrong...
Homer Simpson: (HAPPY GASP)
Lisa Simpson: ...too.
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED SIGH)
Lisa Simpson: While I was gone, I got some really good advice from Paul and Linda McCartney.
Homer Simpson: (ADMIRINGLY) Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know?
Lisa Simpson: I still stand by my beliefs, but I can't defend what I did. I'm sorry I messed up your barbecue.
Homer Simpson: I understand, honey. I used to believe in things when I was a kid.
Homer Simpson: C'mon, I'll give you a piggy-back ride, oops, I mean a veggie-back ride home.
Lisa Simpson: (GIGGLES)

Homer Simpson: There it is! The chain that put the "fat" in "fat Southern sheriffs!"
Homer Simpson: I want a colossal donut. Just like the one on the sign.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Nuts!
Homer Simpson: That's false advertising! Lard Lad lied!

Ned Flanders: Help me! Help me, Lord!
Homer Simpson: I told you: Flanders has it. (IDEA) Or Moe! (PUSHING HIM A LITTLE) Go kill Moe.
Marge Simpson: Homer! Just give him the donut. Once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror.
Homer Simpson: (RELUCTANT) Well... okay. If it'll end horror.
Homer Simpson: Don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time?
Marge Simpson: (MEEKLY) Sometimes.

(AD AGENCY: INT. AD AGENCY - continuous)
Mr. Van Brunt: (THOUGHTFULLY) Well, sir, advertising is a funny thing. If people stop paying attention to it, pretty soon it goes away.
Lisa Simpson: Like that old woman who couldn't find the beef?
Mr. Van Brunt: Exactly. If you stop paying attention to the monsters, they'll lose their powers.
Lisa Simpson: But people can't help looking at them. They're wrecking the town.
Mr. Van Brunt: You know, maybe a jingle would help.
Mr. Van Brunt: (HALF SINGING) Don't watch the... (DIFFERENT MELODY) ... don't watch the.... (FANCY MOVE)... monstersssss. (BEAT) It'll sound a lot better comin' outta Paul Anka.

Nelson Muntz: He ran his floor-buffer over me!
All Parents: NAY!
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLES) Children, I couldn't help monitoring your conversation. There's no mystery about Willie. Why, he simply disappeared... Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Remember, class, the worse you do on this standardized test, the more funding the school gets, so don't knock yourselves out. You have three hours to complete--

Lisa Simpson: (SMALL) Sorry.
Professor Jonathan Frink: Here is an ordinary square...
Chief Wiggum: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Egghead!
Professor Jonathan Frink: But suppose we extend the square beyond the two dimensions of our universe, along the hypothetical Z axis there.

Homer Simpson: (NOTICES HER, SCREAMS)
Lisa Simpson: I must protest. You're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.

Dr. Nick Riviera: Now there are many options available for dangerously underweight individuals like yourself. I recommend a slow, steady gorging process, combined with assal horizontology.
Homer Simpson: Of course.
Dr. Nick Riviera: You'll want to focus on the neglected food groups, such as the whipped group, the congealed group, and the choc-o-tastic.
Homer Simpson: What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?
Dr. Nick Riviera: Be creative. Instead of making sandwiches with bread, use Pop-Tarts. Instead of chewing gum, chew bacon.
Bart Simpson: You could brush your teeth with milkshakes!

Homer Simpson: I was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- Honey, I'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability.
Marge Simpson: (HORRIFIED GASP) Have you lost your mind?! Have you thought about your health?... Or your appearance?
Homer Simpson: (HURT) So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow.
Marge Simpson: Oh please, I would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--

Homer Simpson: (WHINY MOAN) I've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or I gotta face another day at work.
Bart Simpson: Bad news, Dad, we're out of food. We're even out of the basic elements of food. You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce.

Homer Simpson: (EAGERLY) Well, I use a computer!
Salesman: (QUICK, ASIDE) What's the connection? Must be the non-stop sitting and snacking. (LEADING HOMER TO A RACK) Well, sir, many of our clients find pants confining. So we offer a range of alternatives for the ample gentleman: ponchos, muu-muus, capes, jumpsuits, uni-sheets, muslin body rolls, academic and judicial robes...

Marge Simpson: (CONCERNED MURMUR) I'd like to, honey, but I'm not sure how. Your father can be surprisingly sensitive. Remember when I giggled at his Sherlock Holmes hat? He sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency.
Lisa Simpson: Well, maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings. The longer he lives like this, the harder it'll be to go back.
Marge Simpson: (RESIGNED) You're right. Maybe if I use my least nagging tone of voice. (TRYING OUT DIFFERENT TONES:) (CLINGY) Homer? (ACCUSATORY) Homer! (ULTRA WHINY) Homer! That's it. That's the one. All right, send him on in.

Moviegoer: Hey, Fatty! I got a movie for ya -- "A Fridge Too Far."

Bart Simpson: What?
Lisa Simpson: Just shut up and listen. There's something fishy about Grandma. Whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject. And just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, I don't trust her either. When I was going through her purse, look what I found.
Lisa Simpson: (READING) Mona Simpson, Mona Stevens, Martha Stewart, Penelope Olsen, Muddy Mae Suggins...

Marge Simpson: She's nice.
Homer Simpson: But?
Marge Simpson: I just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. You could get hurt again.
Homer Simpson: First, it wasn't 25 years. It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason.
Marge Simpson: Which was?
Homer Simpson: I 'unno. (THINKING) I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.

Postal Clerk: That's what happens when you don't tip your letter carrier at Christmas.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, I'd like to send this letter to the Prussian consulate in Siam by aero-mail. Am I too late for the 4:30 auto-gyro?
Postal Clerk #2: (SQUEAKY TEENAGE VOICE) I better look in the manual.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ach. The ignorance.
C. Montgomery Burns: Wait a minute, I know that woman. But from when and in what capacity?
C. Montgomery Burns: (GASPS) It's her! At last!

Waylon Smithers: Uh, sir, phrenology was dismissed as quackery 160 years ago.
C. Montgomery Burns: Of course you'd say that...
C. Montgomery Burns: You have the brain-pan of a stagecoach tilter.
Fbi Agent #2: (HARRY MORGAN VOICE) At any rate... The FBI will track down this mystery woman and put her behind bars.
Fbi Agent #2: How does it happen, Joe?
Fbi Agent #1: How does what happen?
Fbi Agent #2: How does a sweet young lady mortgage her future for a bunch of scraggly ideals and greasy-haired promises?
Fbi Agent #1: Maybe she thought the war in Southeast Asia was so immoral her end justified the means.
Fbi Agent #2: Gee, Joe. You haven't been the same since your son went crazy in Vietnam.
Fbi Agent #1: It's a pain that never ends.

Mona Simpson: Oh, I'm glad to see the spirit of the '60s is still alive in you kids.
(Springfield Cemetery: Ext. Springfield cemetery - same time)

Mona Simpson: You know, Lisa, it might be nice to rest for a while.
Homer Simpson: Mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?
C. Montgomery Burns: I've been waiting twenty-five years for this moment.
Waylon Smithers: I'm sorry, sir. I must have taped over that.
Fbi Agent #1: Freeze! FBI! The jig is up!

Mona Simpson: Don't worry, Homer. You'll always be a part of me.
Mona Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Krusty the Clown: (SERIOUS) I'd like to thank everybody who contributed to Krusty's Kanned Food Drive. Your generous donations have made this our slipperiest, slimiest Slobstacle Course ever! (KRUSTY CHUCKLE)
Krusty the Clown: Our contestants will drop out of my nose and blurp into a tub of refried beans. From there, they'll stumble down a sluice of rich, eggy bearnaise sauce. How can we afford it? It's rancid!
Sideshow Mel: (STRUGGLING NOISES)
Krusty the Clown: And at the finish line -- a scrumptious parfait of pudding, pickle brine and detergent, where a writhing pile of kids will grope blindly for hot dogs. (KRUSTY CHUCKLE)

Lisa Simpson: Don't you remember, dad?
Lisa Simpson: He framed Krusty. He tried to kill Aunt Selma. He rigged an election.
Bart Simpson: And he tried to murder me.
Homer Simpson: (NOSTALGIC) Oh, yeah... But what I'll mainly remember is the laughter. I wonder what he's doing now?
(Springwood Minimum Security Prison: ext. SPRINGWOOD MINIMUM SECURITY PRISON - DAY - establishing)

Chief Wiggum: Shut yer word-hole! We gotta get this place clean for the air show.
Sideshow Bob: Air show? Buzzcut Alabamians spewing colored smoke from their whiz-jets to the strains of "Rock You Like A Hurricane"? What kind of country-fried rube is still impressed by that?
Lisa Simpson: Wow! / Air show! / Cool! / (AD LIB ETC.)
Marge Simpson: (TRAILING THE GROUP, UNENTHUSIASTIC) Yeah.

GRANDMA: Friend? You mean you two aren't knockin' boots?!
Tv Audience: (HOOTS AND HOLLERS)
GRANDMA: Ever do the backseat mambo, Craigy?

Lou: Right.
Airman Tour Guide: At this point in time, I would like to direct your attention to the particular air vehicle next to which I am currently standing. The Harrier jet is one of our more dollar-intensive ordnance delivery vectors.
Marge Simpson: Five tires?! Am I seeing things?

Bart Simpson: Look at that hunk o' junk.
Grampa Simpson: (SPUTTERING) You're ignorant! That's the Wright Brothers' Plane! At Kitty Hawk in 1903, Charles Lindbergh flew it fifteen miles on a thimble full of corn oil. Single-handedly won us the Civil War, it did.
Bart Simpson: So how do you know so much about American history?
Grampa Simpson: I pieced it together, mostly from sugar packets.
M.P.: Authorization code?
Sideshow Bob: (IMITATING COLONEL) Code?! Son, this is Colonel Hapablap. That fool McGuckett sprayed runway foam all over Chuck Yeager's Acura. Now get down there with a chammy. Triple-time!

Bart Simpson: (SHOCKED GASP) Sideshow Bob!
Spectators: (GASPS AND SURPRISED SOUNDS)
Sideshow Bob: Hello, Springfield. Sorry to divert your attention from all the big noises and shiny things, but something's been troubling me lately: television. Wouldn't our lives be so much richer if television were done away with?
Moe Szyslak: What?!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Surely he's not talking about VH-1!
Sideshow Bob: Why, we could revive the lost arts of conversation... and scrimshaw. Thus, I submit to you: we abolish television. Permanently.
Homer Simpson: (DERISIVE) Go back to Massachusetts, pinko!
Sideshow Bob: Oh, and one more thing, I've stolen a nuclear weapon. (GESTURES TO BOMB) If you do not rid this city of television within two hours, I will detonate it. Farewell.
Sideshow Bob: (AFTERTHOUGHT) By the way, I'm aware of the irony of appearing on TV in order to decry it, so don't bother pointing that out.
Marge Simpson: (FRANTIC) Kids, everything's going to be okay! Don't panic! Just don't panic!
Lisa Simpson: Mom! Mom, you're stepping on my heels and knocking my shoes off!

Mayor Joe Quimby: (GRIMLY) We only have twenty minutes left. Send in the esteemed representatives of television.
Krusty the Clown: Hey, hey! Now this is my kind of meeting!
Mayor Joe Quimby: Gentlemen, it's time we face up to the un-face-up-to-able. We must sacrifice television in order to save the lives of our townspeople.
Krusty the Clown: Whoa, whoa, hoa, hoa, let's not go nuts. Would it really be worth living in a world without television? I think the survivors would envy the dead.

Krusty the Clown: What is the freakin' holdup?
Lisa Simpson: Goodnight, Mom.
Colonel: What is your major malfunction, Sideshow Bob?!
Marge Simpson: Oh, my little sugar-bug... (MORE KISSES) I'm so glad you're safe...
Bart Simpson: Mo-om! You're embarrassing me in front of the Army guys.
Sideshow Bob: How ironic. My crusade against television has come to an end so formulaic it could've spewed from the Powerbook of the laziest Hollywood hack...
Grampa Simpson: Hey, everybody! I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza!
Lisa Simpson: (IN UNISON) Here we go again!
Marge Simpson: (TRAILING, UNENTHUSIASTIC) ...go again.
Announcer: Live from the Springfield Civic Auditorium, it's "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular!"
Audience: (THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE)
(Springfield Civic Auditorium: INT. SPRINGFIELD CIVIC AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS)
Troy McClure: Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such Fox Network specials as "Alien Nose-Job" and "Five Fabulous Weeks of the Chevy Chase Show." (MORE)
Troy McClure: Tonight we're here to honor America's favorite non-prehistoric cartoon family. You'll see long-lost footage...never-before-seen material from your favorite episodes...old favorites you can't see in syndication...
Troy McClure: So join me, won't you, for "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular!"
Troy McClure: "The Simpsons" began as the brainchild of cartoonist Matt Groening,...the already-famous creator of such comics as "Damnation," "Johnny Reb," and "True Murder Stories".
Troy McClure: In nineteen eithty-seven, Groening teamed up with award-winning producers James L. Brooks...and Sam Simon.
Troy McClure: And what better place to premier their creation than on "The Tracey Ullman Show" -- the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes and musical comedy numbers. On April 19th, 1987, America first met... the Simpsons.
Homer Simpson: Well, goodnight, son.
Bart Simpson: Um, Dad...
Homer Simpson: Yeah.
Bart Simpson: What is the mind? Is it just a system of impulses, or is it something tangible?
Homer Simpson: Relax. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind. (LAUGHS)
Bart Simpson: Thanks, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Good night, son.
Marge Simpson: Goodnight, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: I will, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Lisa Simpson: (SCARED) Bedbugs?
Marge Simpson: (SINGS) ROCKABYE BABY IN THE TREE TOP / WHEN THE WIND BLOWS / THE CRADLE WILL ROCK / WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS / THE CRADLE WILL FALL / AND DOWN WILL COME BABY, CRADLE AND ALL.
Maggie Simpson: (FRIGHTENED SUCKING)
Marge Simpson: Sweet dreams.
Homer Simpson: We may be the best parents in the world.
Marge Simpson: (CONTENTED SIGH) Goodnight, dear.
Homer Simpson: Goodnight.
Maggie Simpson: (URGENT INTELLIGIBLE CONCERNS)
Marge Simpson: (WEARY) All right, climb in.
Homer Simpson: There's nothing to worry about. Now everyone go to sleep. Good night.
Troy McClure: (BREAKS INTO LAUGHTER) They haven't changed a bit, have they? As the weeks went on, so did the cartoons!
Marge Simpson: Fresh chocolate chip cookies.
Marge Simpson: Don't touch those yet. They're very, very hot.
Bart Simpson: Aha! No one's around. The perfect crime.
Bart Simpson: Yeow!
Homer Simpson: Do I smell cookies? (GASP) Where's the cookies?
Marge Simpson: They're all gone. The whole batch.
Homer Simpson: Somebody ate those cookies.
Marge Simpson: Did you eat the cookies, Maggie.
Homer Simpson: I think she's trying to tell us something.
Marge Simpson: Go on Maggie.
Homer Simpson: Go on, Maggie. Go. Go.
Bart Simpson: (MOAN) There's no perfect crime. (MOAN)
Bart Simpson: I've got a great idea. Let's play Space Patrol.
Lisa Simpson: (PUTS POT ON HER HEAD) I'll be Lisui... the devil-may-care rocket pilot.
Bart Simpson: Maggie can be Maggina, her spunky sidekick.
Lisa Simpson: ...and you'll be Bartron, the evil robot from Mars, gone berserk.
Lisa Simpson: (HOLDING MALLET) Do I understand you correctly, Bartron? Do you wish me to release you from the helmet of evil thoughts with my enchanted space wand?
Bart Simpson: (UNINTELLIGIBLE ANSWER)
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Yes!
Lisa Simpson: I will do it, Bartron. Who knows what mysterious forces will be unleashed?
Lisa Simpson: Oh no. Inside, the evil Bartron is a horrible mutant boy.
Lisa Simpson: We'll be safe here till Mom and Dad, the evil overlords gets home.
Troy McClure: As wacky as those kids were, they were no match for Captain Wacky -- later
Troy McClure: renamed "Homer."
Homer Simpson: Wake up everybody! It's World War Three!
Bart Simpson: (SCREAMS)
Homer Simpson: Quick, down to the fallout shelter! The bombs are dropping!
Homer Simpson: Eighteen seconds, hmph. If this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. Say, you're all shivering. Are you cold or what?
Homer Simpson: Bart! (BEAT) Bart! Time for your Sunday night bath, boy!
Bart Simpson: Gotta hide.
Homer Simpson: Bart! Where are ya, boy.
Bart Simpson: (BURP) Oops.
Homer Simpson: Aha!
Homer Simpson: There you go. Now that's not so bad, is it?
Bart Simpson: Ahhhh. (PICKS UP SUBMARINE) Welcome to ze exotic world of undersea explorer Bart Simpson.
Bart Simpson: Come with Bart as he dive into the briny deep, searching for the wily and elusive wash cloth. Suddenly, without warning, the great Bart get more than he bargain for.
Bart Simpson: Help! Help!
Bart Simpson: Clean as a whistle, Homer!
Troy McClure: Maybe the drawings were a little crude, but all the characters were there: Itchy & Scratchy...Grampa Simpson...and Krusty the Klown!
Troy McClure: When we return: more classic moments and, for the first time on TV, our private reel of Simpsons outtakes -- including the alternate endings to "Who Shot Mr. Burns?"
Announcer: In the opening credits, what does the cash register say when Maggie is scanned?
Announcer: It says... "N.R.A. Forever!" (CHIPPER) Just one of the hundreds of radical right-wing messages inserted into every show by creator Matt Groening.
"Matt Groening": (MEAN TEXAS ACCENT) Get outta my office!!
Lee Carvallo: Don't do it, son. How's that game gonna help your putting?
Troy McClure: Over the six years "The Simpsons" has been on the air, we've received dozens of letters from fans wanting to know more about the show. Tonight we'll answer some of your questions. Professor Lawrence Pierce of the University of Chicago writes, "I think Homer gets stupider every year." That's not a question, Professor. But we'll let the viewers judge for themselves.
Homer Simpson: Hello. My name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.
Postal Worker: Okay, Mr. Burns. Uh, what's your first name?
Homer Simpson: I don't know.
Marge Simpson: Well Homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
Homer Simpson: Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!
Homer Simpson: Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.
Marge Simpson: Well, duh.
Homer Simpson: Yabba dabba doo!
Homer Simpson: (SINGING) SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE (SHRIEKS)
Homer Simpson: (TO BUZZ AND RACE) Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard.
BUZZ: Homer, no!
Race: They'll clog the instruments!
BUZZ: (DODGING CHIPS) Careful, they're ruffled!
Homer Simpson: I'll take care of this.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAM) Ants!
Ants: (UPSET SQUEAKING)
Ant #1: SUBTITLE: PROTECT THE QUEEN!
Ant #2: SUBTITLE: WHICH ONE'S THE QUEEN?
Ant #3: SUBTITLE: I'M THE QUEEN.
Ant #4: SUBTITLE: NO YOU'RE NOT.
Ants: (UPSET SQUEAKING)
Homer Simpson: (RE: CEILING) ..."No TV and No Beer Make Homer..." something, something.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED) Go crazy?
Homer Simpson: Don't mind if I do. (CRAZY NOISES)
Troy McClure: Doctor Linus Irvin of the Sloan-Kettering Memorial Institute writes, "How does Matt Groening find the time to write and draw an entire 'Simpsons' episode every week?" For the answer to this, we went straight to the source.
(MATT GROENING'S OFFICE: INT. MATT GROENING'S OFFICE - DAY)
Troy McClure: Of course, what Matt meant to say -- according to his attorneys -- is that he couldn't possibly do it alone. And he insisted that we make time to acknowledge the hard work of everyone who makes "The Simpsons" possible.
Troy McClure: Ambassador Henry Mwabwetumba of the Ivory Coast writes, "What is the real deal with Mr. Burns' assistant, Smithers? You know what I'm talking about." (CHUCKLES SLYLY) Of course we do.
Waylon Smithers: ...the preparations for your birthday have begun.
C. Montgomery Burns: (MUTTERING) I won't get what I really want
Waylon Smithers: No one does.
C. Montgomery Burns: (COOING À LA MARILYN MONROE) Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers.
Waylon Smithers: (CONTENTED SIGH)
Waylon Smithers: People like dogs, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?
Waylon Smithers: Uh... if you did it, sir?...I'll - uh -print you out a copy.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks.
C. Montgomery Burns: (COMPUTER VOICE) Hello, Smithers. You're quite good at turning me on.
Waylon Smithers: Um, you probably should ignore that.
C. Montgomery Burns: (MOANS) I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you're in bed and they fly in through the window?
Troy McClure: As you can see, the "real deal" with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr. Burns' assistant.
Troy McClure: He's in his early 40's, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing! We'll be right back.
Announcer: Which popular "Simpsons" characters have died in the past year?
Announcer: (CHIPPER) If you said Bleeding Gums Murphy and Dr. Marvin Monroe, you are wrong. They were never popular.
(Springfield Civic Auditorium: INT. SPRINGFIELD CIVIC AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS)
Troy McClure: Right about now you're probably saying "Troy, I've seen every SimpsonS episode. You can't show me anything new". (LOW, SURPRISINGLY ANGRY) You've got some attitude, mister. (CHEERY AGAIN) Besides, you're wrong! Because sometimes episodes run long and certain scenes never get aired. So fire up your VCR, because here for the first time ever are the cut-out classics.
Bart Simpson: Oh. A soiled wig.
Troy McClure: When Krusty the Klown got cancelled, he tried everything to stay on the air. Here's what you didn't see...
Kids: (SCREAMING)
Krusty the Clown: If you watch my show, I will send you this book featuring me (HOLDS UP BOOK) in a variety of sexually explicit positions.
Krusty the Clown: It's not me! I used a stunt butt.
Network Executive #1: Krusty, we're from the network. We have some bad news. I'm afraid your show's been cancelled.
Krusty the Clown: I thought this would happen. I just hope you replace me with something as educational and uplifting as I've tried to be.
Network Executive #2: Actually, it's a hemorrhoid infomercial starring Claude Akins.
Krusty the Clown: Can I play Hemorrhoid Sufferer #1? (ACTING) Ooh... ooh, that hurts. Is there no relief?
Network Executive #1: I don't think so.
Krusty the Clown: Well, how about one of the "after" guys? (ACTING) Ah... Ah, that's better. I can ride a bike again
Network Executive #1: Sorry.
Krusty the Clown: (SAD NOISE)
Troy McClure: When Springfield legalized gambling, Homer became a blackjack dealer... and comedy was in the cards!
Troy McClure: Earlier this year, Homer's long-lost mother returned, and so did a long-lost care package...
Supervillain: Twenty. Your move, Mr. Bont.
Bont: I'll take a hit, dealer. (GETS CARD) Joker? You're supposed to take those out of the deck!
Homer Simpson: Ooh, sorry. Here's another one.
Bont: What is this card? (READING CARD) "Rules for Draw and Stud Poker?"
Supervillain: What a pity, Mr. Bont...
Bont: But, but, (POINTING TO HOMER) It was Homer's fault! I didn't lose! I never lose!
Bont: Well, at least tell me the details of your plot for world domination...
Supervillain: (CHUCKLES) Oh, I'm not going to fall for that one again.
Troy McClure: Earlier this year, Homer's long lost mother returned, and so did a long-lost care package.
Mona Simpson: Homer, please. You don't have to wolf down that twenty-five-year-old candy just to make me happy.
"Mario" #2: (ITALIAN ACCENT) The store is-a so rich, she'll-a never notice.
Homer Simpson: (STOPS EATING) But it won't make you unhappy, right? (STARTS EATING) Hey! Space Food Sticks! (TAKING A BITE) Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure! Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom?
Mona Simpson: Oh, sure. I read all about it. I mean, it was national news. (A BIT CONFUSED) Do you still work for NASA?
Homer Simpson: No, I work at the nuclear power plant.
Mona Simpson: (NOT PLEASED) Oh, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Well, you'll be happy to know I don't work very hard. (BEAT) Actually, I'm bringing the plant down from the inside.
Troy McClure: When Homer sold his soul for a donut, he found out that Hell isn't all it's cracked up to be, in these never-before-broadcast scenes...
Homer Simpson: (ROLLING SCREAM)
Marge Simpson: Lawyers... lawyers. Ooh, Lionel Hutz. (READING) "Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free." (HOPEFUL MURMUR)
Bart Simpson: (FAKE SINCERITY) I'd sell my soul for a Formula One racing car!
Devil: That can be arranged.
Bart Simpson: Changed my mind. Sorry. (DEVIL GLARES AT BART AND VANISHES) Cool!
Marge Simpson: (ANGRY) Bart! Stop pestering Satan!
Lizzie Borden: Your honor, we find that Homer Simpson's soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson and not of the devil.
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo! (JUMPS UP, BURNS HEAD ON FLAMING CAGE) Ow!
Lionel Hutz: Well, I didn't win. Here's your pizza.
Marge Simpson: But we did win!
Lionel Hutz: That's okay. The box is empty.
Troy McClure: If that's what they cut out, what they leave in must be pure gold! Let's watch some more of those fabulous "Simpsons" outtakes!
Troy McClure: (PHONY INCREDULITY) Apu living with the Simpsons? It happened! And here's a scene you didn't see...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: I'm hoping you enjoy this movie. It made every Indian critic's top 400 list.
(Country Road: Ext. country road)
Indian Woman: (SINGING) LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE / I'M IN LOVE WITH LOVELY JOHNNY...
(INDIAN PALACE: Int. Indian palace)
Bare-chested Man: (AGGRESSIVE HINDI) Kuttay! Kaminay! Sooer kay batchay!
(Simpson Living Room: Int. Simpsons living room - continuous)
Bart Simpson: (TO APU) This movie you rented sucks.
Bart Simpson: No, let me try the cup and ball.
Homer Simpson: No it doesn't, it's funny. Their clothes are different from my clothes. (LAUGHS DERISIVELY) Look at what they're wearin'. (LAUGHS)
Troy McClure: A few years back, Bart was adopted by Mr. Burns. (EMOTIONAL) In this very special outtake, Homer attempts a reconciliation with his estranged son. Watch.
Homer Simpson: Bart, you're coming home.
Bart Simpson: I wanna stay here with Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO HOMER) I suggest you leave immediately.
Homer Simpson: (COCKY) Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst.
C. Montgomery Burns: My worst, eh? Smithers, release the robotic Richard Simmons.
Richard Simmons Robot: C'mon big boy, shake the butter off those buns!
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMS)
Richard Simmons Robot: C'mon, c'mon girls! Shake shake shake!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, it's out of control.
Waylon Smithers: I'll take him out, sir.
Richard Simmons Robot: SHAKE, SHAKE SHAKE \ SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE \ (BECOMING OMINOUS) SHAKE YOUR HINEY!
Waylon Smithers: His ass is gonna blow!
Troy McClure: This past summer, all of America was trying to solve the mystery of "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" (FAST) Then they found out it was the baby. (BEAT) (COUGH) To keep this bombshell secret, the producers animated several solutions that were never intended to air...
Troy McClure: And to keep the show's animators, editors, staff, and hangers-on from leaking the solution, two completely different endings were produced -- one real, one phony. Here's the ending you were never meant to see...
C. Montgomery Burns: The one who shot me was...
C. Montgomery Burns: Waylon Smithers!
Waylon Smithers: Nooo! Wait a minute. Yes.
C. Montgomery Burns: With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world...
C. Montgomery Burns: So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.
C. Montgomery Burns: I feel like celebrating.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about?
C. Montgomery Burns: (GASPS) I see.
Milhouse Van Houten: Get your own!!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance.
C. Montgomery Burns: Or so I thought. At the last moment, Smithers, drunk as a lemur, lurched out of the darkness and fired.
Waylon Smithers: That's right. Just before I'd shot Jasper. I was busy that night.
C. Montgomery Burns: Stricken I lurched forth in search of aide.
C. Montgomery Burns: But finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial.
Lisa Simpson: Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and S. Waylon Smithers.
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you're recovered and we can all get back to normal.
C. Montgomery Burns: Not exactly. Smithers, for attempting to kill me, I'm giving you a five percent pay cut.
Waylon Smithers: (MOANS)
Troy McClure: But of course, for that ending to work, you would have to ignore all the Simpson DNA evidence. (CHUCKLES) And that would be downright nutty.
Troy McClure: Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way since an old drunk made humans out of his rabbit characters to pay off his gambling debts. Who knows what adventures they'll have between now and the time the show becomes unprofitable? (BEAT, TURNS TO CAMERA) I'm Troy McClure, and I'll leave you with what we all came here to see -- hard-core nudity!
Announcer: It's..."A Krusty Kinda Kristmas!" Brought to you by: I.L.G. -- "Selling your body's chemicals after you die," and by Li'l Sweetheart Cupcakes -- a subsidiary of I.L.G.
Krusty the Clown: (TO CAMERA) Oh, hi! I didn't hear you come in. (SETS DOWN TURKEY) Welcome to my home. (CHUCKLES)
Krusty the Clown: Say, did I hear some carolers?
Carolers: (TO "LITTLE DRUMMER BOY"; AMATEURISH) RUM-PA-PUM-PUM / RUM-PA-PUM-PUM / COME, THEY TOLD ME (ETC.)
Krusty the Clown: (RE: MAN) Hey, it's respected private citizen Tom Landry!
Krusty the Clown: (RE: WOMAN) And South American sensation...
Krusty the Clown: (TRIES TO SAY IT) Shoo-shi-sha... Shoo... Sha... She... Shoo... Shoo, boy (KRUSTY GROAN)
Announcer: Now, stay tuned for a video Christmas card from Tupac Shakur!
(Simpson Home: Int. SIMPSON HOUSE - TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS)
Lisa Simpson: Hey, I thought Krusty was Jewish...
Mangy Santa: (THROUGH LOUSY SPEAKER) Morry Hasshass ana Offy Ew Ear. (CLICKS OFF)
Lisa Simpson: Christmas is a time when people of all religions come together to worship Jesus Christ.
Kids: (YAWNING) Bo-ring!
Kids: (FAST) Help!
Santa Claus: (PRO WRESTLER VOICE) Ya want excitement?! Shove this up yer stocking!!
Bart Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Whoa!!
Lisa Simpson: Hmm. That looks entertaining.
Bart Simpson: (WHILE GURGLING LUSTILY) Oh, yeah.
Santa Claus: (TO CAMERA) So tell your folks: Buy me "BoneStorm" or go to hell!
Bart Simpson: Buy me BoneStorm or go to hell!!
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Homer Simpson: (CORRECTING) Young man, in this house, we use a little word called "please"...
Bart Simpson: It's the coolest video game ever!
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, honey, but those games cost up to and including seventy dollars. And they're violent and they distract you from your schoolwork.
Bart Simpson: (CALM) Those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result in me getting the game.
Homer Simpson: I know how you feel, Bart. When I was your age, I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. (BEAT) Well, goodnight.
Bart Simpson: (SIGHS) Oh, I'll never get that game.
Marge Simpson: Tuck-in time!
Marge Simpson: (SINGING) ALL ABOARD THE SLEEPY TRAIN / TO VISIT MOTHER GOOSE / BARTY'S STOP IS SNOOZY LANE / TO REST HIS SWEET CABOOSE.
Bart Simpson: Mo-om, I'm not a little kid anymore. Tuck-in Time is lame.
Marge Simpson: Well, if loving my kids is "lame," then I guess I'm just a big lame.
Bart Simpson: Mom, it's lame to be proud of being lame.
Marge Simpson: (FEISTY) Well, life is like a box of chocolates --
Bart Simpson: (TRYING TO STOP HER) Mom! No, Mom!
Marge Simpson: -- You never know what --
Marge Simpson: --- you're gonna get...
(Street: Ext. STREET - THE NEXT DAY)
Marge Simpson: (EXCITED GASP) Ninety-nine cents!
(The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop: Int. COMIC BOOK STORE - CONTINUOUS)
Bart Simpson: I want to buy a copy of BoneStorm. Here's ninety-nine cents.
"Donkey Kong": ("GOOFY" VOICE) It's the company's fault for making you want it so much.
Comic Book Guy: (SIGHS) Allow me to summarize the proposed transaction: you wish to purchase BoneStorm for ninety-nine cents. Net profit to me: negative fifty-nine dollars.
Comic Book Guy: Oh, oh please take my fifty-nine dollars. I don't want it. It's yours.
Comic Book Guy: Seeing as we are unfamiliar with sarcasm, I shall close the register at this point... (HE DOES) ... and state that ninety-nine cents is the rental price.
Bart Simpson: (EXASPERATED) Then may I please rent it, please?
Comic Book Guy: No, you may not. I am all out. Though I do have a surprising abundance of Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge.
Bart Simpson: (FRUSTRATED MOAN)
(Sidewalk: Ext. SIDEWALK - A LITTLE LATER)
Bart Simpson: Milhouse has BoneStorm!
(Van Houten Home: Int. VAN HOUTEN HOUSE - MILHOUSE'S ROOM - A SECOND LATER)
Milhouse Van Houten: This is great! And all I've done is enter my name! "Thrillhouse!"
Bart Simpson: (SLY) Say, Cool Dude, can I play, too?
Milhouse Van Houten: Uh, uh... it's only a one player game.
